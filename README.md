# Universal Automation Wiki

The **Universal Automation Wiki (UAW)** is an interactive simulation platform for designing, validating, and optimising real-world automation processes. Build dynamic workflow models with drag-and-drop timeline editing, resource management, and real-time validation against hundreds of industry-standard metrics.

Unlike traditional process documentation, UAW combines collaborative knowledge building with hands-on simulation capabilities, allowing users to not only explore automation processes but also test and validate them through our interactive playground.

## The Problem: Abstract Planning vs. Real Implementation

Traditional automation planning relies on static diagrams and expert intuition, making it difficult to identify genuine bottlenecks, resource conflicts, or implementation challenges. Most process models can't be tested, validated, or optimised before expensive real-world implementation.

## The Solution: Interactive Simulation-First Design with Knowledge Base Support

UAW bridges this gap with a **simulation-first approach** backed by collaborative knowledge building.

*   **Interactive Timeline Modelling:** Design workflows with drag-and-drop task scheduling, resource allocation, and actor coordination.
*   **Real-Time Validation:** Immediate feedback on structural integrity, resource conflicts, timing constraints, and economic feasibility.
*   **Multi-Persona Analysis:** Evaluate simulations from different perspectivesâ€”hobbyist, researcher, investor, educator, field expertâ€”with customised validation criteria.
*   **Knowledge Base Integration:** Build upon a growing library of validated automation processes across industries.

## Core Simulation Features

*   **Interactive Playground:** Web-based simulation editor with Monaco-powered JSON editing and visual timeline manipulation
*   **Real-Time Validation Engine:** Validate against built-in metrics including resource flow analysis, timing constraints, economic calculations, and structural integrity checks
*   **Custom Metrics in the Validation Engine:** Users can define their own custom metrics to validate their simulations and workflows
*   **Visual Timeline Editor:** Drag-and-drop interface for editing task timing, resource allocation, and actor coordination
*   **Process Breakdown Engine:** AI-powered hierarchical task decomposition using local LLMs for realistic workflow generation
*   **Simulation Library:** Collection of validated automation processes sourced from wiki contributions
*   **Community-Driven Validation:** Collaborative improvement of simulation models through community feedback
*   **Extensible Metrics System:** Add custom validation rules and contribute to the growing metrics catalogue

## How Simulations Work

UAW transforms abstract automation concepts into testable, interactive models:

1.  **Process Design:** Use our interactive playground to design automation workflows with timeline-based task scheduling
2.  **Resource Management:** Define actors, equipment, materials, and coordinate their interactions across the simulation timeline
3.  **Real-Time Validation:** Simulations are continuously validated against structural, economic, and operational metrics as you design
4.  **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Evaluate your simulation from different viewpoints using persona-specific validation criteria
5.  **Export & Iterate:** Save validated models as JSON for implementation planning, sharing, or further development
6.  **Knowledge Base Contribution:** Share successful simulations back to the community wiki for others to learn from

## Simulation Use Cases

### Manufacturing Process Design
Model production lines, quality control workflows, and equipment coordination with realistic timing constraints. Test resource allocation strategies and identify bottlenecks before physical implementation.

### Service Workflow Optimisation
Design customer service processes, healthcare delivery workflows, and administrative automation with multi-actor coordination. Validate timing and resource requirements.

### Training & Demonstration
Create interactive process models for training programmes. Visual timeline simulations make complex automation concepts tangible and understandable.

### Investment & Feasibility Analysis
Evaluate automation opportunities with economic metrics, ROI calculations, and operational feasibility analysis. Test scenarios before committing resources.

### Research & Prototyping
Prototype automation scenarios in a risk-free environment. Test different approaches and validate assumptions with quantitative metrics.

### Compliance & Safety Planning
Model workflows with safety constraints and regulatory requirements. Validate processes against compliance metrics before implementation.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand our simulation platform capabilities and knowledge base.

#### ðŸŒŸ **Proposing New Validation Metrics**

The most impactful way to contribute to our simulation capabilities:

1.  **Identify a gap:** Consider metrics like "equipment maintenance scheduling", "energy consumption analysis", or "worker safety compliance"
2.  **Propose it:** Open a **[New Metric Proposal](https://github.com/JamieM0/uaw/issues)** using our issue template
3.  **Collaborate:** Discuss and refine the metric definition with the community
4.  **Implement:** Submit a Pull Request adding the metric to `metrics-catalogue.json` and corresponding validation logic

#### ðŸ’» **Simulation Platform Development**

1.  Fork the repository
2.  Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/simulation-enhancement`)
3.  Implement your changes to the playground, validation engine, or simulation models
4.  Submit a Pull Request with a clear description

#### ðŸ“š **Knowledge Base Contributions**

Share your automation expertise by contributing process documentation that feeds into our simulation library. Well-documented processes become the foundation for new simulation templates.
