# Universal Automation Wiki

Welcome to the Universal Automation Wiki! This project aims to map out automation progress across various domains, helping users understand the possibilities of automation. Our mission is to track the singularity, encourage the development of automation technologies, and provide a structured platform for exploring and contributing to automation workflows.

## Project Overview

The Universal Automation Wiki is built around **Iterative AI**, a technology designed to break down complex tasks into hierarchical trees of steps. Each step can have multiple alternative breakdowns, allowing for diverse approaches to automation. The steps are organized in a file system-based tree structure, where each node represents a folder, and each JSON file within it represents an alternative path.

### Key Features

- **Automation Mapping**: Visualize and track automation progress across different domains.
- **Iterative AI**: Utilize AI to generate and refine automation workflows through community feedback.
- **Community Engagement**: Users can contribute by providing feedback and voting on the best automation approaches.
- **Future Predictions**: Get insights on when full automation will be achievable for various topics.
