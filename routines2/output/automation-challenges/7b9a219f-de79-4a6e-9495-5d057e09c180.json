Imaging data (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) varies significantly in image quality, patient positioning, and acquisition parameters. Clinical data – patient history, lab results, genetic information – is often incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistently recorded across different healthcare systems. Automating diagnosis and treatment planning relies on robust, standardized data, which is extremely difficult to achieve consistently in medicine.  The ‘black box’ nature of many diagnostic tools further exacerbates this issue – understanding *why* an algorithm flagged a particular anomaly is often just as important as the flag itself, and this understanding is frequently obscured by complex algorithms.”"

While they can achieve high accuracy, clinicians struggle to understand *how* the model arrived at a diagnosis or treatment recommendation. This lack of transparency hinders trust and adoption.  In high-stakes medical decisions, clinicians need to understand the reasoning behind an AI’s output to validate it, identify potential biases, and ultimately, take responsibility.  Developing truly explainable AI in medicine – providing clear, human-understandable justifications – is a major technical and conceptual hurdle.”"

Furthermore, clinical judgment – the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources, consider rare cases, and adapt to unforeseen circumstances – remains a uniquely human skill.
