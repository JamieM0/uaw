Automating tasks that require managing this state (e.g., database migrations, application deployments with rollback strategies) is extremely difficult. Transient errors – network glitches, temporary service outages – are common. Robust automation needs to not just detect these errors but intelligently *handle* them, often requiring sophisticated retry logic and rollback mechanisms, which are hard to abstract and generalize.”"

Creating reusable automation components across a heterogeneous server landscape necessitates significant reverse-engineering and customization – a time-consuming and complex process.  Limited API documentation and inconsistent design lead to automation bloat.”"
