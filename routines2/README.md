# Basic Programs
Each program is designed to do 1 well-defined, specific thing, working together they can do a much better job at achieving an overall goal when compared to just asking a large language model to do the work towards the overall goal itself.

Additionally, smaller models, like [gemma3](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3) (recommeded) or [qwen 2.5](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5) can be relied on to accomplish these smaller tasks, which reduces the amount of time waiting for responses from the LLM.
