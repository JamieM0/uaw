        "overall_assessment": "The automation level in bread making varies significantly depending on the scale of operation. Low-scale bakeries primarily rely on manual labor and basic equipment. Medium-scale bakeries incorporate some automation for repetitive tasks, while high-scale bakeries utilize sophisticated, integrated automation systems for nearly all stages of the process. However, the core of bread making – the development of flavor and texture – remains heavily reliant on human skill and experience.  Significant advancements are being made in sensor technology and data analytics to optimize dough formulation and baking parameters, but the 'art' of bread making continues to be a key differentiator."
