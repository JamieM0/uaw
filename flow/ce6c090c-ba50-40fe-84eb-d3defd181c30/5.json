            "title": "Basic Mechanical Assistance",
            "status": "Currently widespread",
            "description": "This phase represents the foundational level of automation in bread making, primarily focused on reducing manual labor through simple mechanical devices. It’s characterized by discrete tasks handled by individual machines or tools.",
            "examples": [
                "**Dough Sheeters (Rollermills):**  These machines use rotating rollers to uniformly spread and thin dough, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual rolling.  Variations range from small countertop models to larger industrial versions.",
                "**Dough Dividers:**  These devices automatically portion dough into consistent weights, eliminating the need for manual measurement and cutting, crucial for uniform baking.",
                "**Hydraulic Dough Lifters:**  Used in larger bakeries, these machines lift and transfer heavy dough troughs, reducing strain on bakers and improving efficiency.",
                "**Automatic Slicers (Blade Slicers):**  Early versions of these machines, often manually operated, used a rotating blade to cut loaves into consistent sizes.  These were a significant improvement over hand-cutting.",
                "**Proofing Cabinets with Temperature Control:** While not strictly automation, these cabinets maintain precise temperature and humidity levels for optimal dough proofing, a critical step that was previously heavily reliant on baker skill and observation."
