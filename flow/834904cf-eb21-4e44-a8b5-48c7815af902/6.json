Medium-scale bakeries may utilize automated dispensing systems for dry ingredients, but still require significant manual labor. High-scale bakeries (large commercial) primarily use manual preparation, though some may have automated systems for large-scale flour dispensing and water treatment."

Some medium-scale bakeries may use automated dividers and shaping machines, but these require skilled operators and are often limited in the variety of shapes they can produce. High-scale bakeries may have automated shaping machines for high-volume production of standard shapes."

        "overall_assessment": "Bread making is a process historically dominated by manual labor. While automation is increasingly prevalent, particularly in high-volume production, it's still largely focused on baking and packaging. Low-scale bakeries maintain a predominantly manual approach, while medium-scale operations are gradually incorporating automation for specific tasks. High-scale bakeries represent the most advanced level of automation, with integrated systems controlling nearly every aspect of the process. However, the core of bread making – the development of flavor and texture – remains heavily reliant on human skill and experience."
