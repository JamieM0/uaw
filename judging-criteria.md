# Judging Criteria
Each content page will need to be judged on how good it is. These are the preliminary criteria for judging them.

## Entire Document

### 1. Technical Depth & Accuracy
**Purpose:**
Make sure users can actually act on the technical insights.

1.1. Clearly outlines the biggest technical roadblocks to full automation.

1.2. Explains how current solutions work and where they fall short.

1.3. Gives a feasibility rating (e.g., “Definitely possible!") backed by evidence.

### 2. Actionability & DIY Potential
**Purpose:**
Help users start automating, even if they’re inexperienced.

2.1. Provides a clear roadmap for automating the process, broken into logical steps.

2.2. Includes beginner-friendly shortcuts or simplified approaches for testing ideas.

2.3. Flags tools or resources that are affordable and easy to access.

### 3. Research Orientation
**Purpose:**
Point researchers to whichever area of the topic needs more focus.

3.1. Highlights unsolved problems that matter most for achieving automation.

3.2. Summarises recent breakthroughs and links to papers/patents.

3.3. Identifies who’s working on solutions (labs, startups) and how to collaborate.

### 4. Predictive Utility
**Purpose:**
Improve predictions about when full automation is likely to be possible.

4.1. Gives timeline estimates tied to trends (e.g., "Robotic arms are getting 20% cheaper yearly").

4.2. Explains key signals that could speed up or slow down progress.

### 5. Accessibility & Clarity
**Purpose:**
Make complex ideas easy to grasp for everyone.

5.1. Avoids jargon or explains it plainly (e.g., "ROS2 = robot brain software").

5.2. Uses visuals (diagrams, progress bars) to show how close we are to automation.

5.3. Passes the "grandma test": Could someone without a background in the topic get the gist?

5.4. Ensure that the content doesn’t patronise the reader, and that complex concepts aren’t overly simplistic

5.5. Option to learn more about a topic.

5.6. Highlights existing products, and related people and companies in the field.

### Completeness & Maintenance
**Purpose:**
Keeps content fresh, relevant, and useful.

6.1. Sources are recent and trustworthy (no outdated blogs or shady forums).

6.2. Logs changes over time (e.g., "2023: Added self-cleaning oven tech").
