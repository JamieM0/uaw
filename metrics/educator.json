They value clarity, modularity, and age-appropriateness. They are interested in how a topic connects to broader learning objectives and whether it can be used to teach concepts across disciplines. They look for well-defined terminology, real-world analogies, and content that can be adapted to different age groups and formats (quizzes, projects, discussions).",
