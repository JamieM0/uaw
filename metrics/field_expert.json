  "biography": "The field expert is a professional with deep knowledge of the domainâ€”engineer, technician, or automation architect. They are looking for precision, implementation-ready detail, and references to standards or regulations. They expect domain-specific terminology, risk analysis, and data that supports verifiability and integration into larger systems. They are not concerned with accessibility or pedagogy but rather with whether the information is technically sound and practically deployable.",
