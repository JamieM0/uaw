However, low-scale (e.g., personal vehicles) relies on consumer-grade sensors and basic processing, while medium-scale (e.g., robotaxis) utilizes higher-resolution and more sophisticated sensor suites. High-scale (e.g., fleet deployments) leverages redundant sensor systems and real-time data fusion for increased reliability and accuracy. Calibration and maintenance are also automated to a degree."

        "overall_assessment": "The automation landscape for autonomous vehicles is currently at a 'Medium' level across all scales. While significant progress has been made in sensor technology, data processing, and control algorithms, full autonomy (Level 5) remains elusive. The highest levels of automation (Level 4 and 5) require extensive testing, validation, and regulatory approval, which are still under development.  The technology is rapidly evolving, and future advancements, particularly in AI and sensor technology, will likely drive further automation improvements, particularly in medium and high-scale deployments.  However, safety and reliability remain the primary focus, and a gradual, phased approach to automation is likely to be the dominant trend."
