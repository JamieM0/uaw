  "input_text": "Making bread from scratch is simple and rewarding! Here's a basic recipe for homemade bread:\n\nIngredients:\n3 ½ cups (450g) all-purpose or bread flour\n1 ¼ cups (300ml) warm water (around 110°F/45°C)\n2 ¼ teaspoons (7g) active dry yeast (or 1 packet)\n1 ½ teaspoons salt\n1 tablespoon sugar (or honey)\n1 tablespoon olive oil (optional, for softer bread)\nInstructions:\n1. Activate the Yeast\n\nIn a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast.\nLet it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy. (If it doesn’t foam, your yeast might be expired.)\n2. Make the Dough\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.\nAdd the yeast mixture and olive oil.\nMix until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. Knead the Dough\n\nTransfer to a floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.\n(Or use a stand mixer with a dough hook for about 5 minutes.)\n4. First Rise\n\nPlace dough in a greased bowl, cover with a towel, and let rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.\n5. Shape the Bread\n\nPunch down the dough, shape it into a loaf or rolls, and place it in a greased loaf pan (or baking sheet).\nCover and let it rise again for 30-45 minutes.\n6. Bake\n\nPreheat oven to 375°F (190°C).\nBake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.\n7. Cool & Enjoy\n\nLet the bread cool on a wire rack before slicing..",
