Medium scale employs test management systems to schedule and execute tests, often with some level of automated execution of regression suites. High scale leverages CI/CD pipelines to run automated test execution on every code commit, providing immediate feedback and identifying issues early in the development cycle. Parallel test execution is commonplace."

While low-scale implementations often rely on manual processes, medium and high-scale organizations are actively adopting CI/CD pipelines, AI-powered test generation, and model-based testing to improve efficiency, reduce testing time, and enhance software quality.  The trend towards 'shift-left' testing, incorporating automation earlier in the development lifecycle, is driving significant advancements in automation levels. However, the level of automation is highly dependent on the organization's investment, expertise, and the complexity of the software being developed."
