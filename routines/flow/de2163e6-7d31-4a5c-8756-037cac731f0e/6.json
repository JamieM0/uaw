        "overall_assessment": "Breadmaking automation is significantly lower compared to other food industries like confectionery or processed foods.  Low-scale bakeries operate with minimal automation, primarily relying on traditional techniques. Medium-scale bakeries represent a transition point, utilizing some automated equipment for consistency and efficiency. High-scale bakeries are beginning to adopt more sophisticated automation, particularly in baking and packaging, but a fully automated breadmaking process is still largely absent due to the complexities of dough handling and the need for variation in product quality.  Further advancements in robotic dough handling and sensor-based quality control are likely to drive greater automation in the future, but the artistry and variation inherent in artisan breadmaking will likely always require a degree of manual intervention."
