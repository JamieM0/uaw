Currently, automation efforts are primarily focused on lower-level tasks like circuit optimization and hardware control.  Significant advancements in AI-driven algorithm design, automated error correction, and closed-loop control systems are needed to truly scale quantum computing. The majority of processes remain heavily reliant on human expertise and manual intervention. The ‘Medium’ level across several steps indicates that while progress is being made, substantial investment and innovation are required to move towards widespread, automated quantum computing."
