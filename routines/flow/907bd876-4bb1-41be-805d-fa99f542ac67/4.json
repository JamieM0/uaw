                "title": "Bean Variability & Extraction Precision",
                "explanation": "Coffee beans exhibit enormous variability in density, roast level, and origin, significantly impacting extraction. Achieving consistent and desired extraction profiles (e.g., espresso, pour-over) requires real-time adjustments based on subtle changes in bean behavior – something current automated systems struggle to accurately detect and compensate for. Simple timers and flow rates are insufficient to account for this complexity."

                "title": "Water Chemistry & Temperature Control",
                "explanation": "Optimal coffee brewing relies heavily on precise water temperature control and, critically, water mineral content. Automated systems often struggle to accurately maintain the ideal water profile (pH, hardness, conductivity) throughout the brewing process. Furthermore, replicating the ‘bloom’ phase – the initial degassing of coffee grounds – which dramatically affects extraction, is exceptionally difficult to automate without sophisticated sensors and dynamic adjustments to water flow and temperature."

                "title": "Tactile Feedback & ‘Feel’ of Brewing",
                "explanation": "Experienced baristas rely heavily on tactile feedback – the visual cues of the coffee blooming, the sound of the water flow, and the subtle changes in resistance – to gauge the brewing process and make real-time adjustments. Replicating this sensory input and translating it into automated control is a significant challenge. Current robotic systems lack the dexterity and nuanced understanding required to accurately interpret and respond to these cues."

                "title": "Complex Grinding Profiles & Particle Size Distribution",
                "explanation": "Different brewing methods require drastically different grind sizes and distributions. Achieving a consistently optimal particle size for a specific brewing method (e.g., espresso vs. French press) demands highly sophisticated grinders and precise control over the grinding process. Automating this, especially considering the impact of grind size on extraction and pressure, is a technically demanding undertaking. Simple, pre-programmed grinding profiles are rarely sufficient."

                "title": "Cleaning & Maintenance Automation",
                "explanation": "While automating cleaning cycles (e.g., descaling espresso machines) is achievable, fully automating the complex maintenance procedures involved in coffee brewing equipment – including filter changes, portafilter cleaning, and equipment calibration – remains challenging. These tasks often require manual dexterity and an understanding of equipment-specific nuances."

                "explanation": "The vast array of coffee recipes and brewing techniques – from basic drip coffee to elaborate specialty drinks – necessitates a level of adaptability and judgment that is difficult to codify into an automated system.  Adapting to variations in beans or user preferences requires a degree of ‘common sense’ and intuition that current AI systems lack.  Simply following a pre-programmed recipe will rarely deliver a consistently satisfying result."
