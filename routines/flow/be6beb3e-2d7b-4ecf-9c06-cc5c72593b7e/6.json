While SDN is gaining traction in medium-scale networks, implementation remains challenging and requires careful planning. Low-scale networks generally lack significant SDN automation due to cost constraints and simpler network requirements. The future of SDN lies in greater integration with cloud environments and the development of more user-friendly, scalable automation tools across all network scales."
