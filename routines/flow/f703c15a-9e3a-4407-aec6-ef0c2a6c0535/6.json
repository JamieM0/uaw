        "overall_assessment": "SMT automation levels vary significantly based on production volume. Low-volume operations predominantly rely on manual processes, while medium-scale operations introduce some degree of automation for specific tasks. High-volume production demands fully integrated, highly automated systems incorporating advanced robotics, 3D vision, and real-time process control to optimize throughput, reduce waste, and maintain stringent quality standards. The trend is firmly towards full automation, particularly for higher production volumes, driven by the need for increased efficiency, reduced labor costs, and improved product consistency."
