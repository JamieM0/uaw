        "explanatory_text": "Robotic assembly represents a significant evolution in manufacturing, focusing on the application of robotic systems to perform tasks involved in assembling products, particularly in industries like automotive, electronics, and consumer goods. Currently, the deployment of robots in assembly lines is largely concentrated on repetitive, high-precision tasks that are easily defined and controlled, such as welding, dispensing adhesives, and inserting components. However, the complexity of integrating robots into diverse assembly workflows, managing variations in part designs, and adapting to unforeseen issues remains a primary challenge.\n\nWhile 'pick and place' robots are prevalent, achieving full automation – where robots handle almost all assembly steps – is still in its early stages. Significant advancements are being made in areas like collaborative robots (cobots) that can safely work alongside human operators and in perception technologies allowing robots to understand and react to variations in part presentation. Nonetheless, challenges relating to programming flexibility, error handling, and the cost of robotic integration continue to limit the scope of fully automated assembly lines.\n\nOngoing research and development are driving incremental improvements, including advanced sensor systems for part identification and localization, adaptive control algorithms, and modular robotic systems that can be easily reconfigured for different product assemblies. The 35% progress estimate reflects the demonstrable advances in specific areas and the increasing viability of automating certain assembly stages, but the journey toward ubiquitous, fully automated assembly is still a considerable undertaking requiring substantial investment and continued innovation."
