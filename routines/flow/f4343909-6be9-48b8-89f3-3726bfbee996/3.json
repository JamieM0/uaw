These were largely electromechanical and programmed via cams and levers, representing the nascent concept of automated assembly. Companies like Westinghouse pioneered these systems for automotive parts production. The focus was on repetitive tasks and high-volume output.\","

            "step": "\"1940s - 1950s\": \"World War II Influence - The war dramatically accelerated automation.  Significant advancements in programmable relays and pneumatics fueled the development of more sophisticated assembly lines, particularly in the automotive and aircraft industries.  The US Army's Automated Assembly System (AAS) – a semi-automated system for assembling carburetors – became a key research project demonstrating the potential of automated production.  Early use of electric actuators and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) began to appear.\","

Unimate, developed by George Devol and Victor Scheinman, was the first commercially successful industrial robot. It was a hydraulic arm designed for automating the insertion of die casting parts. FANUC's RP-1000, while a separate development, also pioneered continuous rotational movement, fundamentally changing robotic capabilities.  Programming shifted from manual wiring to teach-pendant interfaces.\","

Increased computing power enabled more complex robot movements and control.  The first iterations of collaborative robots (cobots) emerged, designed for limited interaction with human workers - often for simple tasks like part handling and deburring.\","

Specialized robots developed for specific tasks – welding, painting, dispensing, complex part handling - became widespread.  The rise of ROS (Robot Operating System) facilitated greater flexibility and integration of robots into diverse manufacturing systems. Collaborative robots gained traction, moving beyond simple tasks to assist with more complex assembly operations.\","
