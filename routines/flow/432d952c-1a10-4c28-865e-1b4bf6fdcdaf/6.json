        "overall_assessment": "The automation level in breadmaking varies significantly based on scale. Low-scale bakeries primarily rely on manual labor and traditional techniques. Medium-scale bakeries are beginning to incorporate automation for specific tasks, primarily focusing on efficiency and consistency. High-scale bakeries are aggressively pursuing automation across the entire process, driven by the need for high-volume production, consistent product quality, and reduced labor costs. However, the 'art' of breadmaking – the nuanced understanding of dough development and baking conditions – remains a critical factor, even in highly automated environments."
