            "step": "\"explanation\": \"The fermentation process in breadmaking is incredibly complex and influenced by countless variables – temperature, humidity, yeast strain, flour type, and even ambient air. Current automation struggles to accurately replicate the subtle, dynamic fluctuations needed for optimal dough development. Sensors can monitor temperature and pH, but don’t intrinsically understand the *behavior* of the yeast colonies, predicting peak fermentation activity remains a significant hurdle.  Mimicking the 'feel' of a skilled baker's touch – judging when a dough is sufficiently active – is incredibly difficult to translate into algorithmic control.\""

Achieving consistent loaf shapes (boules, baguettes, etc.) requires precise movements and force control. Simply pushing or rotating dough isn't enough; the impact of these movements on gluten development and gas retention is difficult to model and consistently replicate.  Human bakers instinctively adjust their movements based on visual cues – the dough’s texture, elasticity, and how it resists stretching – which are currently beyond the reach of robotic systems without sophisticated vision and tactile feedback.\""

The timing and extent of gluten network formation are influenced by factors like mixing speed, temperature, and hydration levels.  While machine learning can *correlate* these factors with final dough properties, accurately predicting the dough's behavior – its extensibility, strength, and resistance to gas – in real-time is extremely difficult. Most current systems rely on empirically determined parameters, lacking the predictive capability of a human baker who understands the underlying physics and chemistry of gluten formation.”"

Predicting the impact of these variances on the final product’s color and texture remains a major challenge.”"
