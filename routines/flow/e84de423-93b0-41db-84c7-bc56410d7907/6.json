Medium scale involves automated ADC triggering and basic data logging, often controlled by a central scheduler. High scale incorporates automated calibration routines, adaptive sampling rates based on signal characteristics, and integration with source control for redundancy."

Low-scale implementations often rely heavily on manual intervention, while high-scale implementations are increasingly leveraging machine learning and sophisticated algorithms for real-time analysis and decision-making. The adoption rate of automation is particularly high in sectors like aerospace, defense, and industrial monitoring, where the benefits of improved accuracy, efficiency, and reduced human error are substantial. However, the initial investment in automation, combined with the need for skilled personnel to develop and maintain these systems, remains a key barrier to widespread adoption at lower scales."
