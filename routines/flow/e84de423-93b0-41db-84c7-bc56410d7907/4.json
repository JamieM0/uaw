                "title": "Contextual Understanding & Domain Expertise",
                "explanation": "Automated signal processing relies heavily on domain-specific knowledge – understanding the underlying physical processes generating the signal, the expected noise characteristics, and the potential for non-stationary behavior. Current automation tools struggle to ‘understand’ the context of the signal. For example, automating the analysis of biomedical signals (EEG, ECG) requires knowing that specific artifacts are often correlated with physiological events, and automating the detection of these needs nuanced temporal context.  Simply applying pre-defined thresholds or algorithms without this contextual awareness leads to high false positive and false negative rates."

                "title": "Non-Stationarity & Adaptive Algorithms",
                "explanation": "Signals in many applications (e.g., audio, financial time series, radar) are rarely stationary – their statistical properties change over time.  Automated systems typically rely on static models, making them vulnerable to drift.  Truly automated systems require adaptive algorithms that can dynamically adjust to these changing characteristics. This necessitates real-time learning and adaptation, which presents significant technical hurdles in terms of computational complexity and algorithm design. Traditional model-based approaches are often insufficient without explicit, human-defined adaptation parameters."

                "id": 3,
                "title": "Ambiguity Resolution & Feature Selection",
                "explanation": "Signal processing often involves ambiguous interpretations.  For instance, distinguishing between genuine physiological signals and noise, or identifying specific events within a complex signal.  Automating this involves selecting the *right* features that are truly indicative of the event of interest, while avoiding spurious correlations.  The process of feature selection often relies on human intuition and understanding of the signal’s underlying physics. Current automation struggles to replicate this 'intuitive' process, frequently generating feature sets that are suboptimal or overly sensitive."

                "title": "Complex Signal Interactions & Causality",
                "explanation": "Many real-world signals arise from complex interactions between multiple sources.  Automated systems are frequently limited in their ability to disentangle these interactions and infer causal relationships.  For example, automated speech recognition doesn’t truly ‘understand’ the meaning of the words; it recognizes patterns.  While sophisticated machine learning can approximate this, it often lacks the deep understanding required to handle truly complex scenarios where multiple signals interact in unforeseen ways – requiring the ability to model the underlying physical processes driving those interactions."

                "title": "High Dimensionality & Computational Cost",
                "explanation": "Modern signal processing techniques, particularly those employing deep learning, often deal with very high-dimensional signals (e.g., spectrograms of audio, high-resolution radar data). Processing these signals in real-time is computationally intensive, demanding significant hardware resources and efficient algorithms. Automating the optimization of these complex algorithms for specific applications remains a major challenge."

                "title": "Lack of Generalizable Solutions",
                "explanation": "Signal processing solutions are often highly application-specific. Algorithms that perform well on one type of signal may fail dramatically on a different one.  Automating the discovery of appropriate algorithms – achieving ‘transfer learning’ – remains a persistent difficulty.  It's rare to find an algorithm that can automatically handle the diversity of signal types encountered in practice."
