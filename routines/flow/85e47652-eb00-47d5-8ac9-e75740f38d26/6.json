Medium-scale bakeries see adoption of automated mixers, ovens, and cooling systems. High-scale bakeries operate fully integrated, continuous production lines with extensive automation across nearly all stages, prioritizing consistency, speed, and efficiency. However, the final stages – such as shaping and the nuances of flavor development – still largely require human expertise. The trend is toward increased automation, particularly at higher scales, but there remains a significant premium on skilled labor for quality control and process adjustments."
