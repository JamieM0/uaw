Generate appropriate metadata for the topic provided, including: - A descriptive title (using the topic name) MAXIMUM 2-3 WORDS DO NOT INCLDUE A SUBTITLE (e.g., ANYTHING AFTER A SEMICOLON) - A subtitle that explains the scope - Current automation status (You MUST use one of the below defined terms for automation status. Include ONLY the name, for example, No Automation is a valid response, if it is appropriate for the given topic of course). - Percentage estimate of progress toward full automation (as a percentage). The key MUST be 'progress_percentage'. BE CRITICAL, do not exaggerate current status. E.g., '25%' would be appropriate for topics where some partial automation is POSSIBLE.- Explanatory text (1-3 paragraphs) that describes the topic and its automation journey. This should be returned as a single string under the key 'explanatory_text'. Format your response as a JSON object with these fields.Automation status options:No Automation - Tasks performed entirely by humans without automated tools or systems.Tool Supported - Humans operate specialized tools or GUIs that enhance manual tasks but don't execute them automatically.Support Automation - Systems provide context-aware suggestions and guidance while humans retain execution authority.Scripted Automation - Predefined scripts execute specific sequences of tasks with minimal human intervention.Coordinated Automation - Multiple automated systems are orchestrated through workflows with limited human intervention.Self-Managing Automation - Systems that monitor, adapt, and optimize their performance based on policies without routine human commands.Fully Autonomous (Self-Evolving) - End-to-end processes that operate and adapt over time without human involvement, using ML/AI to improve strategies.",
