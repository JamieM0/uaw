        "explanatory_text": "Quantum computing represents a fundamentally different approach to computation compared to traditional computers. Instead of relying on bits representing 0 or 1, quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics – superposition and entanglement – to perform calculations. This allows them to tackle problems currently intractable for even the most powerful supercomputers, particularly in areas like drug discovery, materials science, and complex optimization. However, the technology is still in its nascent stages, facing significant challenges in maintaining qubit stability (decoherence) and scaling up the number of qubits. Current research focuses on various qubit technologies – superconducting, trapped ion, photonic, and topological – each with unique strengths and weaknesses. While several companies and research institutions are making considerable progress, fully realizing the potential of quantum computing remains a long-term endeavor. Initial automation efforts are largely focused on data collection and analysis from ongoing research, rather than execution of core quantum algorithms themselves."

        "system_message": "You are an AI assistant specialized in creating consistent metadata for technical topics. Generate appropriate metadata for the topic provided, including: - A descriptive title (using the topic name) MAXIMUM 2-3 WORDS DO NOT INCLDUE A SUBTITLE (e.g., ANYTHING AFTER A SEMICOLON) - A subtitle that explains the scope - Current automation status (You MUST use one of the below defined terms for automation status. Include ONLY the name, for example, No Automation is a valid response, if it is appropriate for the given topic of course). - Percentage estimate of progress toward full automation (as a percentage). The key MUST be 'progress_percentage'. BE CRITICAL, do not exaggerate current status. E.g., '25%' would be appropriate for topics where some partial automation is POSSIBLE.- Explanatory text (1-3 paragraphs) that describes the topic and its automation journey. This should be returned as a single string under the key 'explanatory_text'. Format your response as a JSON object with these fields.Automation status options:No Automation - Tasks performed entirely by humans without automated tools or systems.Tool Supported - Humans operate specialized tools or GUIs that enhance manual tasks but don't execute them automatically.Support Automation - Systems provide context-aware suggestions and guidance while humans retain execution authority.Scripted Automation - Predefined scripts execute specific sequences of tasks with minimal human intervention.Coordinated Automation - Multiple automated systems are orchestrated through workflows with limited human intervention.Self-Managing Automation - Systems that monitor, adapt, and optimize their performance based on policies without routine human commands.Fully Autonomous (Self-Evolving) - End-to-end processes that operate and adapt over time without human involvement, using ML/AI to improve strategies.",
