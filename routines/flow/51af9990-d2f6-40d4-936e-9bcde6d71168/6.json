        "overall_assessment": "The automation landscape for breadmaking varies significantly based on scale. Low-scale bakeries primarily operate with manual processes, while high-scale bakeries have embraced extensive automation across nearly all stages, from ingredient sourcing to final packaging. Medium-scale bakeries represent a transitional stage, incorporating some automation but still relying on manual labor for many tasks.  Continued advancements in sensor technology, robotics, and data analytics are expected to drive further automation adoption across all scales."
