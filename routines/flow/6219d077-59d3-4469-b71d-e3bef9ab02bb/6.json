Low and Medium scales rely heavily on manual processes and rule-based systems, while High scales are increasingly leveraging machine learning, SOAR platforms, and real-time threat intelligence. Despite advancements, a common challenge across all scales is the need for skilled personnel to interpret complex data, tune detection rules, and effectively respond to sophisticated attacks. Full automation, particularly for advanced behavioral analysis and SOAR orchestration, remains a significant area of ongoing development and investment."
