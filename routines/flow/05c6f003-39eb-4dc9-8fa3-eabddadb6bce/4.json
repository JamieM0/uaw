                "title": "Dough Handling Precision",
                "explanation": "The precise handling of dough – folding, shaping, and stretching – is a core skill possessed by experienced bakers. Automating this requires robotic systems with extremely delicate manipulation capabilities. Dough is inherently sticky, elastic, and prone to tearing. Current robotic systems lack the tactile feedback and control necessary to consistently achieve the optimal dough development and shaping required for artisan breads. Simply applying force isn’t enough; the system needs to ‘feel’ the dough’s consistency and adjust its actions accordingly."

                "explanation": "Ultimately, breadmaking is about creating a desirable sensory experience. While sensors can measure temperature, humidity, and other physical properties, predicting taste and texture – the key drivers of enjoyment – remains a significant challenge. This requires integrating models of human sensory perception, which are inherently subjective and complex, a capability far beyond the current capabilities of automated systems."
