        "explanatory_text": "Breadmaking is a fundamentally manual craft, relying on precise measurements, careful kneading, and an understanding of fermentation. The process begins with mixing ingredients – typically flour, water, yeast, and salt – and then progressing through stages of kneading to develop gluten, the protein structure that gives bread its texture.  Following kneading, the dough undergoes a period of fermentation, where yeast converts sugars into carbon dioxide, creating bubbles that result in a light and airy loaf. Finally, the dough is shaped, proofed, and baked, transforming into a finished product. While some modern approaches utilize scales and timers to improve consistency, the core steps – mixing, kneading, proofing, and baking – are still performed entirely by a human baker. Currently, there are limited opportunities for automation, primarily around precise temperature control during baking, but the fundamental process remains a hands-on undertaking.  Research into automated dough mixers and shaping tools is ongoing, but widespread automation is not yet feasible due to the complexity of the fermentation process and the variations in dough hydration and environmental conditions that significantly impact the final product."

Generate appropriate metadata for the topic provided, including: - A descriptive title (using the topic name) MAXIMUM 2-3 WORDS DO NOT INCLDUE A SUBTITLE (e.g., ANYTHING AFTER A SEMICOLON) - A subtitle that explains the scope - Current automation status (You MUST use one of the below defined terms for automation status. Include ONLY the name, for example, No Automation is a valid response, if it is appropriate for the given topic of course). - Percentage estimate of progress toward full automation (as a percentage). The key MUST be 'progress_percentage'. BE CRITICAL, do not exaggerate current status. E.g., '25%' would be appropriate for topics where some partial automation is POSSIBLE.- Explanatory text (1-3 paragraphs) that describes the topic and its automation journey. This should be returned as a single string under the key 'explanatory_text'. Format your response as a JSON object with these fields.Automation status options:No Automation - Tasks performed entirely by humans without automated tools or systems.Tool Supported - Humans operate specialized tools or GUIs that enhance manual tasks but don't execute them automatically.Support Automation - Systems provide context-aware suggestions and guidance while humans retain execution authority.Scripted Automation - Predefined scripts execute specific sequences of tasks with minimal human intervention.Coordinated Automation - Multiple automated systems are orchestrated through workflows with limited human intervention.Self-Managing Automation - Systems that monitor, adapt, and optimize their performance based on policies without routine human commands.Fully Autonomous (Self-Evolving) - End-to-end processes that operate and adapt over time without human involvement, using ML/AI to improve strategies.",
