Low-scale bakeries are largely manual, while high-scale operations are incorporating increasing levels of automation, particularly in areas like climate control, oven management, and packaging. However, the inherent variability of dough fermentation and the need for human skill in shaping remain key challenges to fully automating the process.  Future trends will likely see greater integration of AI and machine learning for optimizing fermentation times and baking profiles, but fundamental shaping skills will remain crucial."
