                            Breadmaking, at its core, is a fundamentally manual process, relying heavily on tactile skills, experience, and a deep understanding of dough behavior. While precise recipes exist, achieving consistent results—particularly with artisan breads—demands a degree of artistry and intuition. The process typically involves mixing ingredients, kneading to develop gluten, proofing the dough, shaping, and finally, baking. Currently, significant portions of the process, such as precise temperature control and consistent shaping, remain challenging to fully automate. Robotic arms lack the finesse needed for delicate shaping, and sensors struggle to accurately assess dough elasticity. Many current systems offer support automation – primarily in recipe management and suggesting optimal proofing times based on ambient conditions, but these are tools to augment, not replace, the baker’s experience. Further advancements in tactile sensing and robotic manipulation are needed to move towards greater automation, but a fully automated breadmaking process is still a distant prospect.

Position the flask on a stable, level surface. Using a calibrated fiber optic light source with a wavelength of 550nm (±5nm), illuminate the flask contents. Initiate a 60-second observation period. Record visual observations every 10 seconds: Note color intensity (scale 1-5, 1=dim, 5=bright), presence of foam, and bubble frequency (bubbles per second).  Maintain a constant illumination level of 100 lux.

Begin with the left side of the shelf, moving your eyes horizontally in 10-degree increments.  Focus on each item for a duration of 0.5 seconds, noting its visual appearance, size, and estimated quantity. Record the item&#39;s position relative to a fixed point on the shelf (e.g., 30cm from the left edge).

Maintain a consistent scanning speed – approximately 1 scan per 0.2 seconds – to ensure all items are examined. If an item is difficult to view due to shadows or obstructions, shift your body position slightly (maximum 15 degrees) to gain a better angle of view.

Introduce 7 grams of active dry yeast (Scheringer’s or similar) into the water. Gently stir with a sterilized glass stirring rod for 15 seconds, maintaining a consistent, circular motion of 3 rotations per second. Observe the yeast suspension for 30 seconds; it should exhibit a slight increase in foam and a visible bubbling action.

Secure the cheesecloth tightly over the bowl’s opening with a rubber band. Place the bowl in a room with a consistent temperature of 20-22°C (68-72°F) and low humidity (below 50%). Monitor the humidity using a hygrometer; if the humidity rises above 55%, activate a small, portable dehumidifier set to 30% humidity.

Maintain the 20-22°C (68-72°F) temperature and 50% or less humidity. Periodically check the bloom&#39;s progress every 3 hours, ensuring the temperature and humidity remain consistent.  Observe for a complete surface coating of white crystals – this typically takes 10-12 hours, but may vary.

The surface should be completely covered with a uniform, white crystalline coating. The bloom’s base should be firm and dry, exhibiting a slight tackiness to the touch. If any areas of the bloom appear excessively wet or uneven, gently blot with a clean, dry paper towel.

Using a separate, clean measuring spoon (1 teaspoon - approximately 5ml), carefully measure 3ml of the flavor extract. Dispense the 3ml of extract directly into the 500ml glass containing the water. Observe the liquid level inside the glass.

Initial Assessment: Visually inspect the container of baking powder (approximately 8 ounces) for any signs of moisture – condensation, dampness, or loose granules. Note the exact time of inspection (record in seconds – e.g., 14:32:15). If visible moisture is detected, proceed to step 3a. If no visible moisture is present, proceed to step 3b.

Using the rubber spatula, carefully scoop and transfer approximately 1/4 cup (4 fluid ounces) of the baking powder from the container into a separate, clean, dry measuring cup. Repeat this process three times, transferring approximately 1/4 cup each time. Dispose of the transferred powder (do not return it to the original container). Record the time of the first transfer (e.g., 14:32:20).

Manual De-Clumping: Using the rubber spatula, gently pick up a small amount of the baking powder (approximately 1 tablespoon – measure using the side of the spatula as a guide). Carefully hold the spatula at a 30-degree angle to the measuring cup. Using a back-and-forth motion, spread the baking powder across the inside of the measuring cup, ensuring even coverage. Repeat this process 5-7 times, maintaining a consistent pressure (approximately 2 pounds) with the spatula. Observe the powder’s texture as it spreads. Record the time of the de-clumping (e.g., 14:32:25).

Verify that the baking powder is uniformly distributed and free of clumps. If any clumps remain, return to step 4 and repeat the de-clumping process for an additional 3-5 repetitions. Record the final confirmation time (e.g., 14:32:30).

Position the Ingredient Container: Obtain the container designated for measuring 100 grams of granulated sugar (brand: Domino, product code 70006). Place the container precisely 10 centimeters to the left and 5 centimeters forward from the center of the scale&#39;s platform. Maintain a 90-degree angle between the container and the scale&#39;s platform. Use a ruler or measuring tape to verify this precise positioning, confirming the measurement is within +/- 1mm.

Using a sweeping motion, lift the container upwards, bringing the top edge of the container approximately 2 centimeters above the scale&#39;s platform. Release the container, allowing the sugar to pour onto the scale&#39;s platform. Maintain a pouring speed of approximately 10 grams per second, measured by observing the change in the digital display. Do not allow the sugar to pile up on the scale&#39;s platform – maintain a consistent flow.

Use a small, flat object, such as a rubber eraser, to ensure the cylinder’s base is perfectly level. Use a small ruler or gauge to confirm the cylinder&#39;s base is parallel to the floor with an angle of 0 degrees. Maintain this alignment throughout the measurement process.

If the temperature is rising too quickly (more than 2°C increase per 15-second interval), reduce the power output by 50 watts. If the temperature is rising too slowly (less than 1°C increase per 15-second interval), increase the power output by 25 watts. Maintain power output adjustments in 12.5-watt steps.

Maintain the same circular motion with a 5-centimeter stroke diameter. Observe the mixture for a further 2 seconds, noting any changes in clump size and texture. The visual inspection should confirm a significant reduction in clump size, ideally down to 15 millimeters or less.

Apply a consistent downward pressure of 2 kilograms. Repeat this pushing motion 3 times, each time covering approximately 8 centimeters of the mixture&#39;s surface. Do not introduce new sections of unmixed ingredients.

Ensure the surface is clean and dry. Place a mixing bowl, a whisk, and a digital scale on the workspace. Position the scale directly in front of the bowl, with the base of the scale approximately 15cm from the edge of the counter.

Measure the Wet Ingredients: Using the digital scale, accurately measure 120 grams of unsalted butter, placing the butter block directly on the center of the scale platform. Tare the scale to zero. Slowly lower the butter block until the digital display reads exactly 120.00 grams. Do not attempt to visually estimate; rely solely on the scale reading.

Gently crack each egg individually into a separate small bowl. Carefully roll each cracked egg within its shell for 5 seconds to dislodge any shell fragments. Empty the contents of each bowl into the mixing bowl containing the butter.

Add Sugar to Wet Ingredients: Using the whisk, begin whisking the butter and eggs in a circular motion, maintaining consistent pressure with the whisk handle. Whisk for exactly 30 seconds at a moderate speed (approximately 150 rotations per minute). Observe the mixture - it should become noticeably paler and slightly lighter in consistency.

The foam should be visibly foamy, with bubbles consistent in size, covering approximately 20-30% of the container’s surface area. If the foam volume is significantly less than 20% or significantly more than 30%, repeat the entire process from Step 1, ensuring all measurements and timings are accurate.

Over the next 60 seconds, maintain constant visual focus on the selected point. Record the color changes and any minor surface distortions (e.g., small bubbles, slight depressions) every 5 seconds. Note the exact time of each observation. Record the temperature of the dough using a thermometer, recording it at 30-second intervals.

Record the visual texture - noting the degree of stickiness, the presence of any air pockets, and the overall &#39;feel&#39; of the dough. Repeat this process at 30-second intervals for a total of 3 minutes. Document the measured pressure applied during each tracing.

Using a calibrated measuring spoon, ensure the baking powder fills the entire volume of the teaspoon. Confirm the height of the baking powder within the teaspoon is 1.5 centimeters. Gently tap the teaspoon on a hard surface three times to dislodge any loose powder.

If the dough is excessively sticky, add 1 teaspoon of flour, one at a time, kneading briefly after each addition. If the dough is too dry, add 1/2 teaspoon of water, one at a time, kneading briefly after each addition.
