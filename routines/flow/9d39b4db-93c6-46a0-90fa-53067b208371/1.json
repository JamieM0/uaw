        "explanatory_text": "Breadmaking, at its core, is a fundamentally manual process, relying heavily on tactile skills, experience, and a deep understanding of dough behavior. While precise recipes exist, achieving consistent results—particularly with artisan breads—demands a degree of artistry and intuition. The process typically involves mixing ingredients, kneading to develop gluten, proofing the dough, shaping, and finally, baking. Currently, significant portions of the process, such as precise temperature control and consistent shaping, remain challenging to fully automate. Robotic arms lack the finesse needed for delicate shaping, and sensors struggle to accurately assess dough elasticity. Many current systems offer support automation – primarily in recipe management and suggesting optimal proofing times based on ambient conditions, but these are tools to augment, not replace, the baker’s experience. Further advancements in tactile sensing and robotic manipulation are needed to move towards greater automation, but a fully automated breadmaking process is still a distant prospect."

        "system_message": "You are an AI assistant specialized in creating consistent metadata for technical topics. Generate appropriate metadata for the topic provided, including: - A descriptive title (using the topic name) MAXIMUM 2-3 WORDS DO NOT INCLDUE A SUBTITLE (e.g., ANYTHING AFTER A SEMICOLON) - A subtitle that explains the scope - Current automation status (You MUST use one of the below defined terms for automation status. Include ONLY the name, for example, No Automation is a valid response, if it is appropriate for the given topic of course). - Percentage estimate of progress toward full automation (as a percentage). The key MUST be 'progress_percentage'. BE CRITICAL, do not exaggerate current status. E.g., '25%' would be appropriate for topics where some partial automation is POSSIBLE.- Explanatory text (1-3 paragraphs) that describes the topic and its automation journey. This should be returned as a single string under the key 'explanatory_text'. Format your response as a JSON object with these fields.Automation status options:No Automation - Tasks performed entirely by humans without automated tools or systems.Tool Supported - Humans operate specialized tools or GUIs that enhance manual tasks but don't execute them automatically.Support Automation - Systems provide context-aware suggestions and guidance while humans retain execution authority.Scripted Automation - Predefined scripts execute specific sequences of tasks with minimal human intervention.Coordinated Automation - Multiple automated systems are orchestrated through workflows with limited human intervention.Self-Managing Automation - Systems that monitor, adapt, and optimize their performance based on policies without routine human commands.Fully Autonomous (Self-Evolving) - End-to-end processes that operate and adapt over time without human involvement, using ML/AI to improve strategies.",
