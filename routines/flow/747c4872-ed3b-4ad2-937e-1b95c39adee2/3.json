        "historical": {
            "1920s - 1930s": "Early Automation - Mechanical Assembly & Conveyor Systems. This period saw the initial implementation of mechanical assembly lines, largely pioneered by Henry Ford with the moving assembly line for the Model T. While not ‘robots’ in the modern sense, these systems represented the first steps toward automating repetitive tasks in manufacturing.  Significant development included the introduction of conveyor systems to transport parts and simple mechanical arms assisting with repetitive tasks like applying rivets.  Companies like Ford and later General Motors heavily invested in these systems.",
            "1940s - 1950s": "World War II Influence & Early Industrial Robots.  World War II spurred significant advancements in automation due to the need for mass production of military equipment.  The ‘D-Day Robot’ (Unimate) developed by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger demonstrated the potential of remotely controlled arms for material handling.  While initially focused on metalworking, this marked the birth of industrial robotics.",
            "1960s - 1970s": "Unimate & Programmable Robots.  The Unimate robot (1961) became the first industrial robot, introduced commercially by Unimation. Early robots were largely pneumatic and hydraulic, used for welding and material handling in automotive factories. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) started to integrate with robotic systems, allowing for increased flexibility in programming and control.",
            "1980s - 1990s": "Rise of SCARA Robots & Increased Adoption. SCARA (Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm) robots gained popularity, offering improved dexterity and speed compared to previous designs.  The cost of robots decreased, leading to wider adoption in industries like electronics assembly, food processing, and plastics manufacturing. Sophisticated control systems (PCs) began to be integrated with robotics.",
            "2000s": "Collaborative Robots (Cobots) & Advanced Sensors.  The 2000s saw the emergence of ‘cobots’ – robots designed to work alongside humans, incorporating force sensors and improved safety features.  Advances in vision systems and machine learning started to play a role in robot perception and navigation.",
            "2010s": "Mobile Robots & Increased Machine Learning Integration.  The rise of mobile robotics, particularly in warehousing and logistics, fueled by advancements in GPS, LiDAR, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Machine learning algorithms were increasingly used for robot task planning, object recognition, and adaptive control."

        "predictions": {
            "2020s": "Hyper-Personalized Assembly & AI-Driven Task Allocation. Robots will be increasingly used for highly customized assembly tasks, driven by AI-powered task allocation based on real-time demand.  Smaller, more agile robots will dominate, likely integrated into flexible manufacturing cells.  Advanced haptic feedback systems will enable robots to perform delicate assembly operations with greater precision.",
            "2030s": "Fully Autonomous Assembly Cells & Swarm Robotics. Assembly lines will transition to fully autonomous cells managed by AI.  Swarm robotics will become more common, with teams of small, coordinated robots working together on complex assembly tasks.  3D printing and additive manufacturing will be seamlessly integrated with robotic assembly, enabling on-demand production and customization at an unprecedented scale.  Significant advancements in material science will lead to lighter, stronger, and more adaptable robot materials.",
            "2040s": "General-Purpose Robotic Assembly & Decentralized Manufacturing.  Robots will achieve a level of general-purpose capability, allowing them to adapt to a much wider range of assembly tasks without significant reprogramming.  Decentralized manufacturing, with smaller, geographically dispersed production facilities, will become the norm, driven by automated logistics and robot-managed assembly cells. Human-robot collaboration will be highly sophisticated, with humans primarily focusing on design, creative problem-solving, and oversight.",
            "2050s": "Self-Optimizing Robotic Systems & Biological Integration.  Robotic assembly systems will be self-optimizing, continuously learning and adapting to improve efficiency and performance.  Basic biological components (e.g., soft robotics mimicking human movement) will be integrated into robotic systems, enhancing dexterity and adaptability.  Advanced material science will enable robots to self-repair and recycle materials.",
            "2060s - 2080s (Full Automation – Theoretical)": "The Singularity of Assembly."
