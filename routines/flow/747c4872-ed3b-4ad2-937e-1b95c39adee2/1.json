        "explanatory_text": "Robotic assembly encompasses the utilization of robotic systems to perform the various stages of assembling products, ranging from simple component joining to intricate multi-stage processes. These systems leverage robots equipped with specialized end-effectors – tools like grippers, suction cups, and welding heads – to manipulate and connect parts with precision and repeatability, exceeding the capabilities of traditional manual assembly lines. Current robotic assembly strategies vary considerably based on application complexity, part geometries, and required tolerances, often blending robotic manipulation with pre-programmed movements and human oversight for adjustments or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nDespite significant advances in robot technology, sensor integration, and control algorithms, widespread full automation remains a significant challenge within the broader field of robotic assembly. While advancements in collaborative robots (cobots) and flexible robotic systems have opened new avenues for integration, many assembly processes still require human intervention for tasks demanding adaptability, complex decision-making, or the handling of novel parts. Furthermore, the cost of implementing and maintaining sophisticated robotic assembly lines represents a substantial barrier to full automation across numerous industries.\n\nCurrently, ‘Some Automation’ is the most accurate descriptor. We observe robotic systems utilized in specific stages of assembly, often in conjunction with human operators for tasks requiring dexterity or adaptability. 65% represents a realistic estimate of progress – acknowledging that increased levels of automation, particularly in dynamic or unstructured assembly environments, are achievable through continued innovation in areas such as machine vision, advanced control systems, and adaptive robot programming.”"
