While static analysis and automated testing are increasingly prevalent across all scales, the core of code review remains predominantly manual, particularly in low-scale environments. High-scale teams are pushing towards more automated feedback and integration, but a truly automated code review process is still largely aspirational.  Key areas for improvement include enhanced integration between automated tools and human reviewers, and the development of more sophisticated automated feedback mechanisms that go beyond simple style checks and test execution."
