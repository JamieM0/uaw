Low scale implementations are largely manual, primarily focused on deploying existing models. Medium scale sees the emergence of edge orchestration and data streaming technologies, enabling more dynamic and responsive operations. High scale represents the most advanced automation landscape, integrating edge computing with sophisticated AI, distributed systems, and real-time control. However, challenges remain in areas such as model management, security, and interoperability across diverse edge devices and platforms. The trend is clearly towards increasing automation, driven by the need to handle the exponential growth of data generated at the edge and the demand for real-time responsiveness in applications like industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities."
