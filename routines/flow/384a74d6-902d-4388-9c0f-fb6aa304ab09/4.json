                "title": "Dynamic Environment Complexity",
                "explanation": "SON operates within extremely dynamic and heterogeneous network environments – 5G, LTE, and legacy systems coexisting, coupled with rapidly changing user behavior and service demands. Modeling and predicting this complexity, including interference patterns, channel conditions, and user mobility, is exceptionally difficult. Traditional optimization algorithms often struggle with non-stationary and partially observable environments, leading to suboptimal or unstable solutions."

                "title": "Algorithm Stability and Convergence",
                "explanation": "Many SON optimization algorithms – particularly those based on reinforcement learning – are prone to instability and oscillation. Achieving convergence to a globally optimal solution is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the potential for local optima. Tuning algorithm parameters for stability and convergence requires extensive simulation and real-world experimentation, and even then, guarantees are difficult to obtain."

                "title": "Human Expertise Replication",
                "explanation": "Experienced network engineers possess tacit knowledge – intuition built from years of hands-on experience – regarding network behavior and optimal configurations. Replicating this level of domain expertise in automated systems is a significant hurdle. Current AI approaches struggle to capture the nuanced understanding that comes from dealing with a wide range of network scenarios and troubleshooting complex issues.”"

                "explanation": "Thoroughly verifying and validating the performance of automated SON decisions is critical.  Traditional testing methods are insufficient given the continuous and dynamic nature of the network.  Simulation alone cannot fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios"

Integrating SON automation with these legacy systems—often lacking standardized interfaces or data formats—creates significant technical challenges and introduces additional latency and complexity.”\n    }"
