                "explanation": "At low scale (e.g., a small branch), traffic monitoring might rely heavily on manual packet captures and SNMP data analysis. Medium scale networks may use basic network management systems (NMS) with limited automated anomaly detection. High-scale networks increasingly utilize deep packet inspection (DPI) and machine learning algorithms for real-time traffic analysis and anomaly detection."

                "explanation": "Low-scale networks often use pre-configured QoS rules and limited bandwidth shaping. Medium-scale networks might employ traffic classifiers and basic dynamic bandwidth allocation. High-scale networks leverage sophisticated algorithms like machine learning reinforcement learning and software-defined networking (SDN) controllers to optimize bandwidth distribution in real-time, considering multiple KPIs and network conditions."

                "explanation": "At low scale, QoS is typically configured manually through NMS tools. Medium scale networks use more granular traffic classifiers. High-scale networks utilize SDN and AI-powered controllers to automatically adjust QoS parameters based on network conditions and application requirements, including proactive QoS adaptation."

High-scale networks leverage AI and machine learning to analyze user behavior, traffic patterns, and radio environment data for dynamic cell optimization, including handover and power control."

Medium-scale networks might utilize basic protocol tuning tools, but not with significant automation. High-scale networks leverage advanced analytics to identify protocol inefficiencies and automatically adjust parameters for optimal performance."

        "overall_assessment": "SON automation is currently maturing. While basic automation for monitoring and some fundamental adjustments exists across all scales, true 'self-optimizing' capabilities are primarily found in high-scale, complex networks. The biggest challenges remain in integrating data from disparate sources, developing robust AI algorithms, and ensuring the reliability and stability of automated decisions.  Significant advancements are expected in the coming years, particularly with the widespread adoption of SDN and AI/ML-driven SON solutions, but widespread deployment across diverse network types and scales is still a gradual process. The level of 'self-optimizing' capabilities is directly correlated with network complexity and the level of data available for analysis."
