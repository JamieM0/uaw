            "description": "This phase focuses on automating routine, rule-based tasks and data collection. It’s largely driven by predefined thresholds and manual operator intervention when thresholds are breached. The emphasis is on reducing manual effort in monitoring and reporting.",
            "examples": [
                "Threshold-Based Alarm Management (TBAM): Systems automatically generate alarms based on pre-defined signal levels (e.g., RSSI below a certain value). Operators acknowledge and respond to these alarms – a largely reactive process.",
                "Static Performance Reporting: Automatically generating reports on KPIs like Throughput, Packet Loss, and Latency based on collected data. Human intervention is required to interpret and act upon the reports.",

                "Automatic Handover Scheduling (AHS - Basic): Handover decisions are made based on real-time signal measurements and predefined handover rules. However, the system still incorporates a fallback to manual control if conditions become too complex.",
                "Closed-Loop Interference Management (LIM - Initial): Systems automatically detect and mitigate interference by adjusting parameters, but this is constrained by pre-configured thresholds and operator approval for significant changes.",
                "Automatic Cell Parameter Optimization (CPO - Rule-Based):  Automated adjustment of parameters like Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) based on link quality measurements.  This optimization is limited to a predefined range and requires human validation.",
