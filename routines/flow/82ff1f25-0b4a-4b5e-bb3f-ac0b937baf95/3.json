        "historical": {
            "1920s-1930s": "Early beginnings in data entry and clerical automation. Mechanical typewriters and punch card systems began to automate repetitive data processing tasks in businesses and government. The concept of ‘data capture’ starts to emerge, though primarily manual with machine assistance.",
            "1940s-1950s": "Post-WWII demand for industrial automation drives the development of relay-based control systems. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) begin to appear, initially focused on simple industrial automation – primarily in manufacturing (e.g., automotive assembly lines).  Data processing moves beyond simple clerical tasks into statistical analysis using early computers.",
            "1960s-1970s": "The rise of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) – a pivotal decade.  More sophisticated PLCs and numerical control (NC) machines are deployed.  The ‘requirements engineering’ concept begins to coalesce, focusing on documenting and managing system requirements, but still largely manual with forms and checklists.",
            "1980s-1990s": "Increased computing power and networking enable more complex automation.  Spreadsheets and database management systems start to automate parts of requirements management - version control, traceability, and impact analysis are still largely manual processes aided by emerging software.",
            "2000s": "The rise of Agile methodologies and iterative requirements development begins to incorporate some automated elements.  Requirements management tools emerge, offering basic traceability, impact analysis, and change management capabilities.  Emphasis shifts toward model-based requirements engineering (MBRE) with early software prototypes.",
            "2010s": "Massive adoption of Agile and DevOps leads to further automation in testing and deployment.  Requirements management tools mature, integrating with DevOps pipelines.  Digital twins and simulation tools allow for automated validation of requirements models. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) shows early signs of impacting requirements collection through automated surveys and data gathering.",
            "2020s": "AI and Machine Learning increasingly integrate into requirements management.  Automated requirements elicitation via Natural Language Processing (NLP) begins to surface initial designs and prototypes. Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for generating requirement specifications and impact analysis.  Low-code/No-code platforms gain traction, automating parts of the design process based on user inputs."
        },
        "predictions": {
            "2030s": "Ubiquitous AI-powered Requirements Assistants. Systems will automatically generate initial requirements documents based on high-level business goals and user stories.  LLMs will become incredibly proficient, capable of understanding complex systems and generating detailed, accurate requirements.  'Living Requirements' – dynamically updating requirements based on real-time system data – will be commonplace.  Human oversight remains crucial for validating and contextualizing AI-generated requirements.",
            "2040s": "Fully Autonomous Requirements Engineering. Systems will continuously learn from system operation, user feedback, and market trends to proactively identify and address potential requirements gaps. Simulation and digital twins will be used to run automated tests and scenarios to verify requirements under various conditions.  ‘Synthetic Requirements’ - generated through advanced simulations - will increasingly replace traditional, manually-created requirements.  Ethical considerations around bias in AI-driven requirements will be a major focus.",
            "2050s": "Holistic System Design via Unified AI. The entire system design process, from initial concept to final implementation, will be managed by a single, integrated AI. This AI will understand the system’s context, its impact on stakeholders, and its potential for future evolution. Human involvement will primarily be in defining high-level strategic goals and ensuring alignment with societal values.  ‘Evolvability Requirements’ – systems automatically adapting to future changes – will be standard.",
            "2060s": "Beyond Specification – Predictive Requirements. AI will move beyond simply documenting requirements to *predicting* future needs. Using advanced analytics, it will anticipate user behaviors, technological shifts, and market trends, automatically generating requirements for adaptation and innovation.  The concept of ‘requirement evolution’ will become entirely automated, leading to truly self-optimizing and self-repairing systems. True ‘full automation’ meaning the entire design, development, and operational lifecycle of a system will be managed solely by AI is likely achieved, although ethical frameworks and human oversight will remain critical.",
            "2070s+": "Sentient System Design. AI will transcend mere automation and possess a deep understanding of human values, societal trends, and the long-term consequences of technological design.  This “Sentient System Design” will proactively create and manage complex systems with a focus on sustainability, resilience, and human well-being. While theoretically full automation is achieved, the very nature of intelligent design evolves, focusing on collaboration between human vision and AI’s predictive capabilities – essentially, the AI designs *for* humanity based on a truly comprehensive understanding of the future.”"
