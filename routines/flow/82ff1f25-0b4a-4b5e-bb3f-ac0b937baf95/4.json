                "title": "Ambiguity and Subjectivity",
                "explanation": "Requirements themselves are inherently ambiguous and often expressed subjectively by stakeholders. Automating the understanding and interpretation of these nuanced statements – particularly when dealing with vague language, competing priorities, or undocumented assumptions – remains a core challenge. Current NLP models struggle with this inherent uncertainty, frequently misinterpreting intent and leading to incorrect automation actions."

                "title": "Lack of a Single ‘True’ Interpretation",
                "explanation": "Unlike structured data or well-defined workflows, requirements often have multiple valid interpretations. Automating the selection of the ‘correct’ interpretation based on context, stakeholder priorities, or evolving business needs is incredibly difficult. Establishing a robust mechanism for resolving conflicts and maintaining a consistent understanding across the system is a significant technical hurdle."

                "title": "Dynamic Requirement Evolution",
                "explanation": "Requirements are rarely static; they constantly change due to market shifts, competitive pressures, or new insights. Automating the impact analysis of these changes – identifying affected components, updating related documentation, and triggering necessary rework – demands real-time understanding and sophisticated reasoning capabilities that current automation tools often lack. Simple rule-based systems quickly become obsolete."

                "explanation": "Automated requirements change management systems must maintain a clear audit trail of all changes, including who made them, when, and why. Ensuring the integrity and accuracy of this data, and making it easily accessible for auditing and reporting, is technically demanding and requires robust data governance practices – a factor often overlooked in initial automation efforts.”\n    }"
