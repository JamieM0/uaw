Medium scale: Some tools like survey platforms (e.g., SurveyMonkey) and basic collaboration platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams) are used for distributed gathering. High scale: Primarily manual; sophisticated tools like AI-powered elicitation are rare due to the complexity and need for human nuance."

Medium scale: Some workflow automation within requirements management tools allows for automated routing and approval requests, but the core process remains manual.

While basic tools and workflows are available, true end-to-end automation is rare, particularly at low and medium scales. High-scale projects with complex systems and stringent regulatory requirements are seeing increased automation, largely driven by the need for accuracy, traceability, and efficient change management. The greatest opportunities for automation lie in areas like requirements elicitation, model-based testing, and automated traceability, but a shift towards more comprehensive end-to-end automation will require further advancements in AI and machine learning within the requirements engineering domain."
