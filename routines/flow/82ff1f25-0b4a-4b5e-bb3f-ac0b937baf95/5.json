            "title": "Advanced Automation Systems – Cognitive Assistance & Predictive Analytics",
            "status": "Emerging technology (10-20% of requirements teams)",
            "description": "This phase utilizes advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide more intelligent assistance to requirements teams. It shifts from simply automating tasks to actively helping teams understand requirements, anticipate issues, and proactively manage the complexities of large-scale projects.  Human oversight is still critical for validation, strategic decisions, and contextual understanding.",
            "examples": [
                "**RMTs with Cognitive Requirement Analysis:** Utilizing AI-powered tools that automatically analyze requirements for ambiguity, incompleteness, and potential conflicts – suggesting improvements and clarification prompts.",

        "phase4": {
            "title": "Full End-to-End Automation – Autonomous Requirements Management",
            "status": "Future development (0-5% of requirements teams – highly specialized)",
            "description": "This phase envisions a fully autonomous requirements management process where AI and ML systems handle virtually all aspects of the process, from initial elicitation and documentation to validation, traceability, and change management. Human oversight would be reserved for strategic decisions, complex problem-solving, and ensuring ethical considerations are addressed.  This represents a significant shift in the role of the requirements professional towards a governance and strategic oversight function.",
