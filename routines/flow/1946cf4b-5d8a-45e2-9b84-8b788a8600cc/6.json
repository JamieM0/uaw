While basic SIEM deployments often rely heavily on manual processes, particularly at the low scale, most organizations, even at medium scales, utilize SIEM for log aggregation and rule-based correlation. High-scale implementations represent a significant shift towards AI-powered threat detection and automated incident response, though full automation across all aspects of SIEM is still a maturing area. The trend is clearly towards increased automation, but a layered approach combining human expertise with automated tools is still critical for effective SIEM deployments."
