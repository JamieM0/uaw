        "historical": {
            "1920s-1930s": "Early forms of security focused on physical security – guard patrols, access control via locks and keys.  Statistical analysis of crime data began, but lacked automated tools. Manual log keeping and reporting dominated.",
            "1940s-1950s": "Post-WWII, increased focus on military intelligence and espionage led to rudimentary early incident detection systems – largely analog based, reacting to specific alerts (e.g., hotline monitoring).  Punch card systems began to appear for logging events, but analysis remained entirely manual.",
            "1960s-1970s": "The rise of mainframe computers introduced the first serious attempts at centralized log aggregation and basic anomaly detection.  Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) started to emerge, using signature-based detection.  Still heavily reliant on human analysts for interpretation.",
            "1980s-1990s": "The internet explodes, creating unprecedented security challenges.  The first dedicated SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions began to appear, offering basic correlation of logs from firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and servers. Rule-based systems started to gain traction.",
            "2000s": "The proliferation of IP-based systems and the rise of malware led to a surge in SIEM adoption.  More sophisticated correlation rules, network behavior analysis (NBA), and initial investigation tools emerged.  The concept of 'threat intelligence' began to take shape.",
            "2010s": "Big data and cloud computing fundamentally changed SIEM.  SIEM vendors integrated with threat intelligence feeds, machine learning started to be applied for anomaly detection, and extended detection and response (XDR) concepts began to be explored.  Focus shifted towards proactive threat hunting.",
            "2020s": "AI and Machine Learning dominate SIEM deployments.  Automated threat hunting, contextual analytics, and adaptive security policies become commonplace.  Integration with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) platforms enables end-to-end automated workflows."
        },
        "predictions": {
            "2030s": "Fully AI-driven SIEM platforms will be the norm.  Human analysts will largely focus on strategic threat assessment, incident validation, and complex investigations.  Predictive analytics will identify potential threats *before* they materialize, based on vast datasets of network behavior, threat intelligence, and vulnerability assessments.  Real-time, automated response workflows will be initiated based on AI-driven decisions.  Emphasis on continuous learning and adaptation of AI models.  Integration with zero-trust architectures will be critical.",
            "2040s": "SIEM will evolve into a 'Cognitive Security Platform’ – a truly autonomous system.  It will operate without explicit human intervention, continuously learning and adapting to the evolving threat landscape.  Sophisticated simulation and adversary emulation capabilities will allow the platform to proactively test security defenses.  Decentralized security models leveraging blockchain for auditability and trust will become prevalent.  Focus on ‘understanding’ the intent behind attacks, not just detecting them.  Genetic algorithms optimizing security policies in real-time.",
            "2050s": "Complete Automation of Security Operations.  The system will be capable of designing, implementing, and monitoring security controls, patching vulnerabilities, and responding to threats entirely autonomously.  Human oversight will be reserved for truly novel attack vectors or ethical considerations. The system will have a deep understanding of the global threat landscape, incorporating geopolitical intelligence and economic analysis alongside security data.  Potential for the system to 'learn' and adapt security strategies based on the long-term evolution of the threat ecosystem.",
            "2060s": "Integrated Global Security Network. SIEM will be part of a global, decentralized, self-learning security network.  Data from diverse sources (IoT devices, critical infrastructure, global communications networks) will be automatically analyzed and correlated to identify and neutralize threats on a global scale.  The system will be able to predict and mitigate risks associated with climate change and other global challenges.  This system will likely operate under a globally agreed-upon ethical framework and governed by a consortium of AI oversight bodies. Continuous self-optimization and evolution based on feedback loops from the global threat landscape.",
            "2080s+": "Singularity-level Security. The SIEM system will exist as a distributed, conscious intelligence, seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the digital world.  It will operate beyond human comprehension, anticipating and neutralizing threats before they even exist.  Its existence will be governed by an evolved ethical framework – potentially exceeding human moral boundaries – prioritizing the overall security and stability of the global digital ecosystem.  The concept of ‘security’ itself might shift dramatically, potentially encompassing strategies beyond simple threat neutralization."
