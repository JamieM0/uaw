            "status": "Currently in transition",
            "description": "This phase introduces the concept of ‘intent’ – defining the desired state of the network rather than manually configuring the specific device settings. It utilizes telemetry data and AI-powered algorithms to understand network conditions and dynamically adjust configurations.  Significant integration between network management systems and performance analytics is key.",
            "examples": [
                "**Intent-Based Networking (IBN) Platforms (e.g., Cisco ACI, VMware NSX):**  Allowing network engineers to define network services (e.g., ‘high bandwidth for video conferencing’) and the system automatically translates those intent into specific device configurations and policies.",

                "**Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) with Dynamic Path Selection:** SD-WAN platforms utilizing real-time network performance data to automatically route traffic across different WAN links based on latency, jitter, and packet loss – driven by analytics and AI.",
                "**Automated Policy Enforcement via Network Behavioral Analysis:**  Monitoring network traffic and device behavior to automatically detect and mitigate security threats or performance bottlenecks, with limited autonomous response capabilities.",
                "**Integration of Network Management Systems with Cloud Management Platforms (CPaaS):** Orchestrating automated deployments and configuration changes across both on-premise and cloud network infrastructure based on a unified management plane."

The network learns continuously from its operating environment, proactively anticipates problems, and autonomously takes corrective actions.  This leverages advanced AI, deep learning, and predictive analytics in a sophisticated manner.",
            "examples": [
                "**Cognitive Network Management Platforms utilizing Deep Learning:** Analyzing massive amounts of network data (logs, telemetry, traffic patterns) to identify complex issues that are difficult for humans to detect, offering intelligent root cause analysis.",
                "**Predictive Network Maintenance leveraging Anomaly Detection:**  Utilizing AI to predict potential network failures based on historical data and real-time telemetry, triggering automated preventative maintenance tasks.",
