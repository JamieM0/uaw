Medium scale deployments leverage network design automation tools for simplified topology creation and capacity planning, but significant manual adjustments are still required. High scale environments increasingly use AI-powered design tools and automated topology generation based on service requirements, but human oversight remains crucial for complex integrations and optimal performance."

While Low and Medium scale deployments still rely heavily on manual processes, there's a clear trend towards increased automation through MANO platforms, Kubernetes, and AI-driven analytics. However, interoperability between different automation solutions and the lack of standardized APIs remain significant challenges hindering widespread adoption across all scales. The shift toward cloud-native NFV is driving increased automation, but substantial investments in tooling and skills are necessary to fully realize the benefits."
