Low-scale operations primarily rely on manual processes, while medium-scale operations incorporate some scripting and automation for specific tasks. High-scale manufacturing environments have largely embraced sophisticated ATE systems with integrated data analytics, machine learning, and predictive maintenance capabilities. However, the highest levels of automation require substantial upfront investment and ongoing maintenance expertise, and there is still a significant role for human operators in interpreting results and handling complex issues."
