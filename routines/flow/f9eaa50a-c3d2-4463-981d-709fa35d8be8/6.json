While low-scale implementations are still primarily manual, medium and high-scale environments are heavily reliant on automated tools and platforms for continuous monitoring, prioritization, and remediation. However, the ability to effectively correlate vulnerability data with broader threat intelligence and contextual factors remains a key challenge, particularly at lower scales, hindering truly proactive vulnerability management."
