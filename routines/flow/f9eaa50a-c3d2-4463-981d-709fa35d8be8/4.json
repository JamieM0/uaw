                "title": "False Positive/Negative Rates",
                "explanation": "Automated vulnerability scanners often generate a significant number of false positives (reporting vulnerabilities that don't exist) or false negatives (missing actual vulnerabilities). This is due to variations in code complexity, the ever-changing nature of vulnerability definitions (CVEs), and the reliance on signatures and pattern matching. Achieving a consistently low false positive/negative rate requires ongoing tuning, analysis of scanner reports, and, crucially, human verification, which is a major bottleneck."

                "title": "Contextual Understanding & Code Complexity",
                "explanation": "Scanners struggle to understand the *context* of code. They treat code as a set of patterns rather than understanding the intent or architecture. Complex applications with intricate logic, custom frameworks, or legacy code are particularly difficult to analyze correctly. The lack of true comprehension means scanners might flag innocuous code as problematic and fail to prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities. This requires expert human analysts to determine the actual risk associated with findings."

                "title": "Maintaining Signature Databases & Prioritization",
                "explanation": "Vulnerability databases (like the National Vulnerability Database - NVD) are constantly updated. Automating the process of incorporating these updates into scanners is crucial, but it's difficult to ensure that all newly discovered vulnerabilities are promptly analyzed and incorporated. Furthermore, the sheer volume of vulnerabilities necessitates prioritization – scanners need to identify the *most* critical vulnerabilities based on exploitability and potential impact, a task that remains challenging to fully automate, requiring sophisticated risk scoring and threat intelligence integration."

                "title": "API & Cloud-Native Application Complexity",
                "explanation": "Modern applications increasingly utilize microservices and API-driven architectures. Automated scanning of these environments presents unique challenges. Scanners often struggle to map inter-service dependencies, track API authentication and authorization mechanisms, and identify vulnerabilities related to insecure API configurations.  This requires specialized tools and a deeper understanding of cloud-native security best practices, which are not always readily available in automated scanners."

                "explanation": "Scanning container images (Docker, etc.) is a relatively new challenge.  Scanners often lack the ability to fully inspect the layers of an image, accurately identify vulnerabilities within custom base images, and trace dependencies. This often results in incomplete or inaccurate vulnerability assessments for containerized applications.”\n    }"
