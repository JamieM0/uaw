    "system_message": "You are an AI that breaks down complex tasks into hierarchical steps. For each task, generate a set of sub-steps needed to complete it. Maintain clarity and logical order. IMPORTANT: Avoid duplicating steps that already exist elsewhere in the tree context provided. Focus on sub-steps that are specific to the current task being expanded. Format your response as a valid JSON array of step objects, where each object has a 'step' field and optionally a 'children' array containing substeps. Example format: [{'step': 'Main step 1', 'children': [{'step': 'Substep 1.1'}, {'step': 'Substep 1.2'}]}, {'step': 'Main step 2'}] Your entire response must be parseable as JSON. Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or commentary.",

Task: Generate Remediation Plan: Develop a prioritized plan for addressing identified vulnerabilities, including patching, configuration changes, or other mitigation strategies.\n\nDo NOT repeat steps that have already been created in the tree unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\nFocus on sub-steps that are specific to this task and avoid duplicating steps that already exist in the broader process.\n\n\nExisting steps in the tree (avoid duplicating these): Automated Vulnerability Scanning, Define Scanning Scope: Identify target systems, networks, and applications to be scanned., Determine Overall Business Objectives for Scanning, Identify Critical Assets (Systems & Applications), Map Network Architecture, Categorize Systems by Security Classification, Document Target Systems, Networks, and Applications, Select Vulnerability Scanner: Choose a suitable scanning tool (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys)., Research Available Vulnerability Scanners, Compare Scanner Features and Capabilities (e.g., supported protocols, reporting formats, ease of use), Evaluate Scanner Costs (licensing fees, maintenance costs), Assess Scanner Scalability for the Target Environment, Consider Scanner Community Support and Documentation, Configure Scanner Settings: Specify scan types (e.g., vulnerability scans, compliance scans), credentials, and scheduling., Select Scan Types, Identify Required Scan Types (e.g., vulnerability, compliance, web application), Determine Specific Scan Parameters for Each Type (e.g., depth of scan, specific checks), Define Credentials, Identify User Accounts for Scanning, Securely Store Credentials (e.g., using a password manager or secure vault), Configure Scheduling, Determine Scan Frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), Set Specific Time Windows for Scanning (to minimize impact on systems), Configure Recurring Scan Schedules, Execute Scan: Initiate the vulnerability scan according to the defined settings., Verify Scan Settings Configuration, Initiate Scan Execution, Monitor Scan Progress, Record Scan Start Time, Confirm Scan Completion, Analyze Scan Results: Review the scan report for identified vulnerabilities, prioritizing based on severity and exploitability., Sort Vulnerabilities by Severity, Assess Vulnerability Exploitability, Categorize Vulnerabilities by Business Impact, Document Prioritized Vulnerability List, Validate Vulnerabilities: Confirm the accuracy of identified vulnerabilities through manual verification or additional testing., Conduct Manual Verification of Top Vulnerabilities, Perform Targeted Penetration Testing on High-Risk Systems, Develop Penetration Testing Scenarios based on Scan Results, Execute Penetration Tests using Manual Techniques, Document Observed Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Attempts, Review Vulnerability Scanner Output for Confirmation, Generate Remediation Plan: Develop a prioritized plan for addressing identified vulnerabilities, including patching, configuration changes, or other mitigation strategies.\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON array of step objects, with no markdown formatting, code blocks, or extra text.",
