Cloud computing and IaC have driven a shift towards highly automated environments. However, at low scales, automation is often limited due to resource constraints and a lack of expertise. The trend is strongly towards continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for server infrastructure, incorporating monitoring, logging, and automated scaling. The level of automation varies greatly depending on the organization's size, cloud adoption strategy, and IT maturity."
