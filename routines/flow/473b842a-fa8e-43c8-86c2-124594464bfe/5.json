            "status": "Currently widespread",
            "description": "This phase focuses on automating repetitive, rule-based tasks primarily targeting manual server provisioning, monitoring, and basic incident response. The core principle is 'if-then' rules applied to pre-defined alerts. It's largely driven by human oversight and intervention.",
            "examples": [
                "**Simple Script-Based Provisioning (Ansible/Chef/Puppet - Basic Playbooks):**  Using pre-written scripts to automate tasks like creating new VMs with predefined operating systems and configurations.  Focuses on initial setup, not dynamic adjustments.",
                "**Basic Log Monitoring and Alerting (Nagios/Zabbix - Predefined Checks):** Setting up alerts based on static thresholds for CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk space. Alerts trigger manual investigations and remediation.",
                "**Scheduled Backup Automation (Veeam/Acronis - Simple Scheduling):**  Automated daily or weekly backups of server data to a centralized location.  Management must verify integrity and run restoration tests periodically.",

                "**Basic User Account Management (Active Directory - Group Policy Automation):** Automating user creation and deletion based on predefined criteria (e.g., new hire onboarding, employee termination). Limited self-service capabilities.",
                "**Automated Email Notifications (Custom Scripts Triggered by Alerts):** Sending emails to administrators regarding critical system alerts.  Primarily for notification, not automated resolution."

It introduces dynamic scaling, automated remediation for common issues, and some level of self-healing.  Machine Learning begins to play a minor role in anomaly detection.",
            "examples": [
                "**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Terraform/CloudFormation):** Defining infrastructure configurations as code, allowing for automated deployment and updates of servers and related resources, with rollback capabilities.",
                "**Dynamic Scaling (Kubernetes/Autoscaling Groups):** Automatically adjusting server capacity based on real-time demand, optimizing resource utilization and responsiveness.",
                "**Self-Healing Scripts (PowerShell/Bash - Scripted Remediation):** Scripts designed to automatically address common issues like restarting services, clearing temp files, or applying standard configurations after an outage.",
                "**Log Analytics and Automated Root Cause Analysis (Splunk/Elasticsearch - Rule-Based Correlation):** Using machine learning algorithms to correlate events from various logs to identify patterns and potential root causes of incidents, but requires human interpretation and escalation.",
                "**Automated Capacity Planning based on Historical Data (Using BI Tools connected to Monitoring Systems):**  Using data analytics to predict future resource needs and trigger scaling events proactively. Still heavily reliant on pre-defined thresholds.",
                "**Automated VM Lifecycle Management (Proviso/Orca):**  Monitoring server health and automatically shutting down idle servers or decommissioning servers based on predefined criteria."

            "description": "This phase leverages advanced AI and machine learning to achieve proactive problem solving and high levels of system resilience.  Automation becomes predictive, automatically learning and adapting to system behavior.  Human intervention is primarily for strategic decisions and complex troubleshooting.",
            "examples": [
                "**AI-Powered Anomaly Detection (Machine Learning Platforms - TensorFlow/PyTorch):** Utilizing ML models trained on vast datasets of system behavior to identify anomalies *before* they impact users, predicting potential failures and triggering preventative actions.",
                "**Autonomous Remediation (ServiceNow - AI-Powered Workflows):**  AI workflows that can automatically diagnose and resolve complex incidents with minimal human intervention, incorporating multiple remediation steps based on the identified root cause.",
                "**Predictive Maintenance (Systems with Sensor Data - IoT integration with Monitoring):**  Integrating server data from sensors (temperature, power consumption) with monitoring systems to predict hardware failures and schedule maintenance proactively.",
                "**Automated Configuration Drift Detection and Remediation (Cloud Custodian/Flux):** Continuously monitoring server configurations against a baseline and automatically correcting deviations, ensuring infrastructure compliance.",
