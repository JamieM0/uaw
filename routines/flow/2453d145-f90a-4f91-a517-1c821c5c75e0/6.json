While Low scale deployments often lack significant automation, the adoption of IaC is significantly increasing across all scales.  The most significant growth is seen in High-scale environments where IaC is integrated into complete CI/CD pipelines, driving rapid and reliable infrastructure changes.  Low-scale deployments represent a lagging area with potential for significant improvement, and the transition is driven by the benefits of repeatability, version control, and reduced operational overhead."
