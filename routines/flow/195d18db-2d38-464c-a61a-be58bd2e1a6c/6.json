Medium scale involves some orchestration tools to assist in parameter selection based on pre-defined templates and automated discovery. High scale, with numerous operators and dynamic slice creation, leverages AI/ML for intelligent recommendation and automated template adaptation."

        "overall_assessment": "5G/6G Network Slicing automation is currently in a transitional phase. While significant progress has been made in areas like orchestration and dynamic resource allocation, truly ‘high’ automation, leveraging sophisticated AI/ML for intelligent slice management, is still largely aspirational. Most operators are operating at a ‘Medium’ level, with a focus on deploying NFV, SBAs, and basic automation capabilities. However, the successful widespread adoption of ‘High’ automation will hinge on addressing challenges related to data availability for AI/ML training, standardization across different vendor solutions, and the maturity of network function virtualization technology. The potential for fully autonomous, self-optimizing network slicing is still several years away, requiring substantial advancements in these areas."
