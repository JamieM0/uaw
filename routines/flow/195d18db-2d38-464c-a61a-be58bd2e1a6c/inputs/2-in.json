    "system_message": "You are an AI that breaks down complex tasks into hierarchical steps. For each task, generate a set of sub-steps needed to complete it. Maintain clarity and logical order. IMPORTANT: Avoid duplicating steps that already exist elsewhere in the tree context provided. Focus on sub-steps that are specific to the current task being expanded. Format your response as a valid JSON array of step objects, where each object has a 'step' field and optionally a 'children' array containing substeps. Example format: [{'step': 'Main step 1', 'children': [{'step': 'Substep 1.1'}, {'step': 'Substep 1.2'}]}, {'step': 'Main step 2'}] Your entire response must be parseable as JSON. Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or commentary.",

Task: Deallocate Resources Upon Slice Termination\n\nDo NOT repeat steps that have already been created in the tree unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\nFocus on sub-steps that are specific to this task and avoid duplicating steps that already exist in the broader process.\n\n\nExisting steps in the tree (avoid duplicating these): 5G/6G Network Slicing Automation, Define Slicing Requirements, Identify Business Needs for Slicing, Determine Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for Each Slice, Specify Quality of Service (QoS) Requirements for Each Slice, Define Bandwidth Requirements for Each Slice, Establish Latency Constraints for Each Slice, Determine Security Requirements for Each Slice, Document Data Privacy and Compliance Needs for Each Slice, Allocate Resources Based on Slicing Profile, Assess Slice Profile Attributes, Analyze Slice Template Specifications, Confirm Resource Allocation Targets, Map Resources to Slice Attributes, Identify Required Network Elements, Determine Resource Quantities (e.g., bandwidth, compute), Assign Resources to Virtualized Infrastructure, Select Appropriate Virtual Machines, Configure Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), Validate Resource Allocation, Check Resource Availability, Verify Resource Configuration, Verify Network Slice Performance, Collect Performance Metrics from the Slice, Define Performance Test Scenarios, Execute Performance Tests, Analyze Test Results Against SLA Targets, Identify Performance Bottlenecks, Generate Performance Reports, Monitor Slice Resource Utilization, Collect Current Slice Resource Utilization Data, Compare Collected Data to Baseline Utilization, Identify Anomalies in Resource Usage, Investigate Root Causes of Anomalies, Determine Impact of Resource Utilization on Slice Performance, Document Resource Utilization Findings, Adjust Slicing Parameters Dynamically, Establish Dynamic Parameter Adjustment Trigger, Receive Trigger Signal (e.g., Performance Degradation Alert), Determine Parameter Adjustment Scope (Which Parameters to Modify), Calculate New Parameter Values Based on Trigger and Constraints, Implement Updated Slicing Parameters, Monitor Slice Performance Post-Adjustment, Record Parameter Adjustment and Associated Changes, Deallocate Resources Upon Slice Termination\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON array of step objects, with no markdown formatting, code blocks, or extra text.",
