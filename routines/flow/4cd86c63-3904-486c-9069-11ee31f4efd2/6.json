Low-scale bakeries are slowly adopting simpler automation, primarily for efficiency gains. Medium-scale bakeries are integrating more sophisticated systems, particularly in shaping and baking. High-volume bakeries are at the forefront of automation, leveraging robotics and AI for optimized production, consistent quality, and increased throughput. However, the core of breadmaking – the feel and nuance of working with dough – remains a crucial element, and automation is often focused on augmenting, not replacing, the baker’s skills."
