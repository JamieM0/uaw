        "explanatory_text": "Breadmaking, at its core, is a complex and highly skilled craft involving a delicate balance of ingredients, temperature control, and precise timing. The traditional method relies heavily on manual observation and adjustment, with bakers relying on years of experience to gauge dough consistency, fermentation rates, and oven performance. This inherent variability presents a significant challenge for complete automation, as subtle changes in environmental conditions can dramatically impact the final product’s texture and flavor. However, certain aspects of the process are amenable to partial automation.\n\nCurrently, automation efforts in breadmaking primarily focus on tasks that involve consistent repetition and precise measurements. Automated dough mixers and divider systems are increasingly common in commercial bakeries, allowing for more uniform dough preparation. Similarly, automated proofing chambers and controlled-temperature ovens are utilized to maintain consistent fermentation and baking conditions. Furthermore, robotic arms are beginning to be integrated into shaping and scoring processes, although human intervention remains crucial for achieving the desired artisan aesthetic.\n\nDespite advancements, full automation of breadmaking—particularly for achieving complex, handcrafted loaves—remains elusive. The ability of yeast to react differently in varying conditions, combined with the need for skilled adjustments during shaping and baking, necessitates a degree of human oversight.  The 45% estimate reflects the current stage of development, focusing on systems that increase efficiency and consistency across specific steps, rather than entirely replicating the nuances of traditional artisan breadmaking.”"
