        "overall_assessment": "The automation level in breadmaking varies significantly based on scale. Low-scale bakeries primarily rely on manual processes, while medium-scale bakeries incorporate some automation for specific tasks. High-scale bakeries exhibit the highest levels of automation, particularly in baking and packaging, driven by the need for efficiency, consistency, and large-volume production. However, critical stages like initial dough development and quality control frequently retain a human element due to the complex interplay of variables involved in achieving desired bread characteristics. Moving towards full automation across the entire process remains a significant challenge due to the inherent variability of dough and the importance of sensory feedback."
