            "title": "Basic Mechanical Assistance",
            "status": "Currently widespread",
            "description": "This phase focuses on automating repetitive, physically intensive tasks within the fab, primarily driven by reducing manual labor and increasing throughput. The core principle is to augment human operators with machines performing specific, well-defined actions. Complexity is relatively low, centered around precision movement and controlled force.",
            "examples": [
                "Robotic Arm Material Loading/Unloading (Wafer Carriers): Early automated carriers move wafers between deposition, etching, and cleaning stations. These systems are largely manually controlled, requiring operators to monitor and adjust robot movements.",
                "Automated Carrier Transport Systems (CTS): High-precision, belt-driven systems move wafers across a short distance – typically within a single tool. They are programmed with predefined routes and speeds, but human oversight is crucial for handling wafer jams or variations.",
                "Automated Edge Bead Removal (EBR): Robotic arms equipped with polishing heads perform initial, coarse removal of edge beads – the silicon debris created during etching.  These systems require manual adjustment of polishing parameters.",
                "Automated Lift-Through-Lift (LTL) Systems (Early Stages): Basic LTL systems exist, primarily for transferring wafers between lithography tools. They're largely manual operation with automated wafer pickup and placement based on sensor data.",
                "Automated Chemical Dispensing Systems: Programmable robotic systems precisely dispense chemical solutions for cleaning and etching steps, reducing operator exposure to hazardous chemicals. Still requires operator programming and verification.",

The focus shifts towards process control, feedback loops, and adaptive movement. Significant investment in sensor technology and control software drives this evolution.  Semi-automation means the system operates largely autonomously within a defined process, but requires operator intervention in response to exceptions or unexpected events.",
            "examples": [
                "Closed-Loop Etch Systems: Etch tools are integrated with feedback systems (e.g., optical emission spectroscopy) to monitor etch rate and adjust process parameters (power, gas flow) in real-time. Requires skilled technicians to interpret feedback and make adjustments.",
                "Adaptive Carrier Control Systems (ACC): Carrier systems equipped with vision systems and force sensors adjust speed and trajectory based on real-time wafer surface conditions (detected via optical imaging) to prevent damage.",
                "Automated Lithography Tool Assist: Robotic arms within lithography tools assist with mask alignment, reticle positioning, and minor defect removal – often requiring operator input based on process monitoring.",
                "Predictive Maintenance Systems (Initial): Sensors monitor tool performance (vibration, temperature, power) and predict potential failures, triggering alerts for maintenance teams. Still heavily reliant on human analysis of data.",
                "Automated Defect Mapping and Classification (Basic):  Image analysis systems detect and classify wafer defects, generating reports for engineers. Requires manual validation and correction of classifications.",
                "Automated Bead Cleanup Systems (Advanced): Robotic systems employing multiple polishing heads and varying parameters for optimized edge bead removal based on sensor feedback."

Machine learning and AI algorithms play a crucial role in process optimization, defect detection, and predictive maintenance.  The system is designed to minimize human intervention and dynamically adjust to variations in wafer characteristics and tool performance. High levels of sensor density and sophisticated control algorithms are central to this phase.",
