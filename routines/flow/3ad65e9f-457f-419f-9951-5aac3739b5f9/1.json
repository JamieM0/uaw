        "explanatory_text": "Edge computing represents a significant shift in how computing resources are deployed and utilized. Traditionally, data processing has been centralized in large, powerful data centers. However, the increasing volume and velocity of data generated by IoT devices, mobile applications, and other sources are straining the capacity of these centralized systems. Edge computing addresses this challenge by bringing computation and data storage closer to the source of data, enabling faster response times, reduced bandwidth consumption, and improved reliability. It fundamentally involves processing data at or near the edge of the network – where the data is created – rather than sending it all to a central location.\n\nCurrently, automation efforts within edge computing primarily focus on device management, deployment, and basic monitoring. Tools are emerging to streamline the provisioning and configuration of edge devices, often leveraging containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to ensure consistent environments across the distributed network. Furthermore, there's nascent automation around data pre-processing tasks tailored to specific edge use cases – things like sensor data filtering or initial anomaly detection. However, truly autonomous edge environments, capable of dynamically adapting to changing conditions or optimizing performance without human intervention, remain a significant technical challenge. \n\nLooking ahead, full automation of edge computing will require significant advancements in areas such as AI-driven orchestration, self-healing networks, and sophisticated security protocols.  The evolution of standard APIs and a robust ecosystem of automated tools are key to unlocking the full potential of edge computing and achieving a state of ‘Mostly Fully Automated’ operation.  Continued investment in standardized tooling and improved observability will be critical in accelerating this progression."
