        "explanatory_text": "Breadmaking encompasses a wide range of processes, from simple no-knead recipes to complex artisan techniques. The core of breadmaking involves combining flour, water, yeast, and often salt, to create a dough that undergoes fermentation and baking. Historically, breadmaking was entirely manual, relying on the baker’s skill and experience to manage the dough’s hydration, temperature, and fermentation. While significant advancements have been made in understanding the science behind bread, particularly regarding yeast activity and gluten development, most aspects of the process – including shaping, scoring, and baking – still require human expertise. Current automation efforts focus on aspects like precise temperature control in ovens, dough hydration measurement, and providing guided recipes, however, the artistic and sensory elements of producing high-quality bread remain largely under human control. Current tools and systems offer support for controlling critical variables but do not replace the baker’s fundamental understanding and judgement."

Generate appropriate metadata for the topic provided, including: - A descriptive title (using the topic name) MAXIMUM 2-3 WORDS DO NOT INCLDUE A SUBTITLE (e.g., ANYTHING AFTER A SEMICOLON) - A subtitle that explains the scope - Current automation status (You MUST use one of the below defined terms for automation status. Include ONLY the name, for example, No Automation is a valid response, if it is appropriate for the given topic of course). - Percentage estimate of progress toward full automation (as a percentage). The key MUST be 'progress_percentage'. BE CRITICAL, do not exaggerate current status. E.g., '25%' would be appropriate for topics where some partial automation is POSSIBLE.- Explanatory text (1-3 paragraphs) that describes the topic and its automation journey. This should be returned as a single string under the key 'explanatory_text'. Format your response as a JSON object with these fields.Automation status options:No Automation - Tasks performed entirely by humans without automated tools or systems.Tool Supported - Humans operate specialized tools or GUIs that enhance manual tasks but don't execute them automatically.Support Automation - Systems provide context-aware suggestions and guidance while humans retain execution authority.Scripted Automation - Predefined scripts execute specific sequences of tasks with minimal human intervention.Coordinated Automation - Multiple automated systems are orchestrated through workflows with limited human intervention.Self-Managing Automation - Systems that monitor, adapt, and optimize their performance based on policies without routine human commands.Fully Autonomous (Self-Evolving) - End-to-end processes that operate and adapt over time without human involvement, using ML/AI to improve strategies.",
