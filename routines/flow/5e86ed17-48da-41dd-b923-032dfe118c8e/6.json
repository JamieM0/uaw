While foundational test case design still requires human effort, the execution and reporting phases are largely automated.  The degree of automation is directly proportional to the organization's investment in tooling, training, and architectural shift towards DevOps principles.  However, the quality of automation is dependent on the quality of the initial test design, highlighting the continued importance of skilled testers in the overall testing process."
