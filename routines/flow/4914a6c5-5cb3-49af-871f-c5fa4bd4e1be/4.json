                "title": "Variations in Surface Finish & Lighting",
                "explanation": "AOI systems struggle with inconsistent surface finishes on printed circuit boards (PCBs) and components. Variations in reflectivity, texture, and material properties dramatically affect image quality and, consequently, detection accuracy. Even subtle changes in ambient lighting conditions can introduce noise and artifacts into the image data, leading to false negatives or missed defects. Robust lighting environments are very difficult and expensive to maintain."

                "id": 2,
                "title": "Complex Feature Geometry & Occlusion",
                "explanation": "AOI systems often encounter challenges with inspecting complex geometries, especially small or densely packed components, and with components partially obscured by others.  The ability to accurately interpret visual data in these scenarios is highly dependent on the system’s ability to 'understand' 3D information – something traditional 2D AOI fundamentally lacks. Sophisticated algorithms for feature extraction and shape analysis are needed but are computationally intensive and can be prone to errors when features are partially hidden."

            {
                "id": 3,
                "title": "Defect Type Diversity & Novel Defects",
                "explanation": "AOI systems are typically trained on a limited set of pre-defined defect types.  New defect types, particularly those with unusual appearances or geometries, can quickly render the system ineffective.  The need to continuously retrain and update the system's defect library with new images and algorithms is a significant ongoing challenge.  Furthermore, subtle defects – like micro-cracks – can be very difficult to detect, requiring extremely high resolution and sophisticated analysis techniques."

                "id": 4,
                "title": "Lack of Tactile Feedback & Contextual Understanding",
                "explanation": "AOI relies solely on visual data; it lacks the tactile feedback and contextual understanding that a human inspector possesses.  A human inspector can use touch to assess the quality of a component or determine if a defect is genuine or simply a scratch.  This contextual awareness is incredibly difficult to replicate algorithmically, requiring AI systems that can ‘understand’ the function and intended use of the component."

                "explanation": "Processing high-resolution images from multiple cameras in real-time presents significant computational challenges.  Complex image analysis algorithms, including those involving machine learning, require substantial processing power, potentially leading to bottlenecks and delays in the inspection process. Optimization of algorithms and hardware is crucial for achieving real-time performance, but this often requires significant investment."

                "title": "Calibration & Maintenance",
                "explanation": "Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of AOI systems is an ongoing challenge. Regular calibration of cameras, lighting, and other components is essential to compensate for drift and changes in the production environment.  Furthermore, the system requires periodic maintenance, including cleaning and replacing components, to ensure optimal performance.  Incorrect calibration or maintenance directly impacts inspection accuracy."
