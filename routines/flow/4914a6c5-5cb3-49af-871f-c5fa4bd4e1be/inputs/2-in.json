    "system_message": "You are an AI that breaks down complex tasks into hierarchical steps. For each task, generate a set of sub-steps needed to complete it. Maintain clarity and logical order. IMPORTANT: Avoid duplicating steps that already exist elsewhere in the tree context provided. Focus on sub-steps that are specific to the current task being expanded. Format your response as a valid JSON array of step objects, where each object has a 'step' field and optionally a 'children' array containing substeps. Example format: [{'step': 'Main step 1', 'children': [{'step': 'Substep 1.1'}, {'step': 'Substep 1.2'}]}, {'step': 'Main step 2'}] Your entire response must be parseable as JSON. Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or commentary.",
    "user_message": "Break down the following task into 3-7 sub-steps. Task: Human Review (Optional): Periodically review a sample of AOI results to validate system accuracy and adjust criteria if needed.\n\nDo NOT repeat steps that have already been created in the tree unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\nFocus on sub-steps that are specific to this task and avoid duplicating steps that already exist in the broader process.\n\n\nExisting steps in the tree (avoid duplicating these): Automated Optical Inspection (AOI), Define AOI Criteria: Establish specific visual defects to be detected (e.g., scratches, cracks, missing components)., Identify Critical Defects: Determine the most critical defects to prioritize for detection based on product impact and business requirements., Define Defect Types: Detail specific types of defects (e.g., scratches - light, medium, deep; cracks - hairline, major; missing components - quantity, location)., Establish Tolerance Levels: Set quantifiable tolerance levels for each defect type (e.g., maximum scratch length, maximum crack width, acceptable missing component quantity)., Define Measurement Parameters: Specify how defects will be measured â€“ e.g., using pixel dimensions, area calculations, or other relevant metrics., Document Defect Criteria: Create a formal document outlining all established defect criteria, including type, tolerance levels, and measurement parameters., Configure AOI System: Calibrate cameras, adjust lighting, and set inspection parameters based on defined criteria., Camera Calibration Verification: Verify camera calibration accuracy using a calibration target and adjust parameters as needed to meet specified accuracy requirements., Lighting Intensity Adjustment: Fine-tune the lighting intensity based on the product surface and defect types to optimize defect visibility., Parameter Setting: Input the defined inspection parameters (e.g., pixel size, area calculation thresholds) into the AOI system., Test Run with Representative Samples: Execute a test run with a small set of representative product samples to assess the system's performance under the current settings., Performance Monitoring: Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as detection rate, false positive rate, and processing time., Implement Image Acquisition: Initiate the AOI system to capture images of the product under inspection., Initiate AOI System Capture, Select Product for Imaging, Trigger Image Acquisition Sequence, Verify Image Capture Completion, Record Image Acquisition Timestamp, Analyze Images: Utilize image processing algorithms to identify potential defects automatically., Implement Image Preprocessing, Apply Defect Detection Algorithms, Filter False Positives, Quantify Detected Defect Dimensions, Compare Measured Dimensions to Tolerance Levels, Generate Defect Classification Output, Generate Pass/Fail Report: Automatically create a report classifying each product as either passing or failing based on inspection results., Define Pass/Fail Criteria Based on Inspection Results, Categorize Products by Inspection Outcome (Pass/Fail), Generate Report Template with Product Details, Populate Report with Pass/Fail Status for Each Product, Format Report for Output (e.g., CSV, PDF), Verify Report Data Accuracy, Human Review (Optional): Periodically review a sample of AOI results to validate system accuracy and adjust criteria if needed.\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON array of step objects, with no markdown formatting, code blocks, or extra text.",
