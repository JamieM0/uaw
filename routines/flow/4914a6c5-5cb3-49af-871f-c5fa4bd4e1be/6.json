                "explanation": "At low scale (e.g., small electronics repair shops), manual inspection is standard. Medium scale facilities may use simple, handheld visual inspection tools. High-volume manufacturers primarily rely on trained operators, although some basic defect classification may be implemented."

Medium-scale operations might incorporate basic visual inspection stations with cameras and simple algorithms. High-volume manufacturing uses sophisticated AOI systems capable of identifying a wide range of defects, including component placement errors and solder quality issues."

High-volume manufacturers utilize high-resolution CMMs and laser scanners integrated into the AOI system for precise dimensional verification."

While low-scale operations may utilize basic visual inspection techniques, medium and high-scale manufacturers leverage sophisticated AOI systems offering high levels of automation and accuracy.  The trend is towards increasing integration of AOI with other manufacturing systems, including automated assembly and real-time feedback loops.  The cost of AOI systems has decreased significantly, making them accessible to a broader range of manufacturers. However, the complexity and sophistication of AOI systems continue to increase, requiring skilled operators and maintenance personnel."
