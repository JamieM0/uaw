While significant automation is emerging in data collection, monitoring, and reporting, manual processes remain prevalent, especially in policy creation and initial risk assessment. High-scale deployments, integrating SOAR and advanced analytics, are still relatively uncommon and require substantial investment in technology and expertise. A key trend is the increasing use of AI and Machine Learning to augment human capabilities, but a truly automated compliance program is still a future-state aspiration rather than a widespread reality."
