            "title": "Basic Mechanical Assistance",
            "status": "Currently widespread",
            "description": "This phase represents the initial adoption of automation focusing on rule-based responses and simple alerts. It’s characterized by reactive, pre-defined actions triggered by alerts. There's little contextual understanding or learning involved.",
            "examples": [
                "SIEM Rule-Based Alerts & Actions: Triggering basic notifications (e.g., email, SMS) based on predefined rules (e.g., ‘Alert if source IP is blocked’ or ‘Alert if port 80 is open’ ).",
                "Firewall Rule Automation (Basic): Automatically blocking a known malicious IP address based on threat intelligence feeds – typically a simple 'blacklist' approach.",
                "Antivirus Signature Updates: Automatically downloading and installing updated antivirus signatures from a central repository.",
                "Log Monitoring & Reporting: Automated collection and reporting of log data, often with limited correlation and analysis.  Generating basic dashboards showing event counts.",
                "Vulnerability Scanning - Alerting Only: Scheduling vulnerability scans and immediately notifying security teams when vulnerabilities are detected – without automated remediation.",
                "Initial Incident Response Playbooks – Guided Scripts: Using scripts to execute very basic steps like isolating an infected system, but relying heavily on manual verification and confirmation."

        "phase2": {
            "title": "Integrated Semi-Automation (Currently in transition)",
            "status": "Currently in transition",
            "description": "This phase focuses on integrating different security tools to automate more complex, sequential actions.  It leverages correlation between data sources and some basic learning capabilities, often involving basic playbooks triggered by more intelligent alerts.  The core remains largely rule-based, but with improvements in data enrichment.",
            "examples": [
                "SOAR Playbooks for Incident Triage: Automated initial triage of alerts across multiple security tools (SIEM, endpoint detection, threat intelligence) to determine severity and potential impact – triggering actions like creating tickets in a ticketing system.",
                "Automated Endpoint Isolation: Automatically isolating a compromised endpoint based on initial detection by an EDR solution, including network segmentation and application shutdown.",
                "Threat Intelligence Enrichment & Alert Routing: Automatically enriching security alerts with contextual data from threat intelligence feeds (e.g., reputation scores, malware analysis reports) and routing alerts to the appropriate security team based on the threat type.",
                "Automated Phishing Simulation Execution: Triggering phishing simulations based on specific user behavior or threat intelligence indicators.  Limited automated tracking of engagement.",
                "Automated Log Correlation - Anomaly Detection: Using statistical anomaly detection to identify unusual network traffic patterns and trigger alerts – with basic rule adjustments based on identified patterns.",
                "Automated Response to Known Vulnerabilities (Patching):  Automated patching of systems identified as vulnerable through vulnerability management tools - often requiring manual approval before execution."

            "title": "Advanced Automation Systems (Emerging technology)",
            "status": "Emerging technology",
            "description": "This phase focuses on using machine learning and behavioral analytics to proactively identify and respond to threats. Systems are learning from observed data and adapting their responses accordingly.  Contextual understanding becomes much more sophisticated, leading to significantly more autonomous actions.",
            "examples": [
                "Behavioral Analytics-Driven Threat Hunting: Employing machine learning algorithms to analyze user and device behavior and proactively identify anomalous activity indicative of a potential attack.",
                "Dynamic SOAR Orchestration with Adaptive Playbooks: Playbooks that adapt in real-time based on observed threat behavior, dynamically adjusting response steps based on contextual intelligence.",
                "Automated Deception Technology Deployment & Management: Automatically deploying and managing decoy systems and services to lure attackers and gather intelligence.",
                "Automated Malware Analysis & Sandboxing:  Automatically analyzing suspicious files in a sandbox environment, utilizing ML to identify malicious behavior and signatures.",
                "Automated Vulnerability Prioritization Based on Threat Context: Leveraging threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability data to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts, focusing on the highest-risk vulnerabilities first.",
                "Automated Network Segmentation Based on Threat Intelligence: Dynamically adjusting network security policies based on threat intelligence, automatically segmenting networks to limit the spread of attacks."

        "phase4": {
            "title": "Full End-to-End Automation (Future development)",
            "status": "Future development",
            "description": "This phase represents a truly autonomous and adaptive security posture. Systems operate with near-zero intervention, constantly learning, predicting, and responding to threats in real-time.  Integration goes beyond individual tools to encompass entire ecosystems, including cloud environments and third-party services.  Human oversight remains, but is focused on strategic decisions, not operational tasks.",
            "examples": [
                "AI-Powered Threat Prediction and Prevention: Utilizing advanced AI models to predict future attacks based on historical data, threat intelligence, and emerging trends – actively preventing attacks before they occur.",
                "Autonomous Security Operations Center (SOC): A fully automated SOC where AI and ML systems handle all aspects of threat detection, investigation, and response, with human analysts focused on strategic decision-making and oversight.",
