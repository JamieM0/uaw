                "title": "Semantic Understanding",
                "explanation": "Current code generation models, primarily Large Language Models (LLMs), struggle with genuine semantic understanding of code. They excel at pattern matching and statistical relationships within code snippets but often fail to grasp the underlying intent, design principles, or system architecture. This leads to generated code that is syntactically correct but logically flawed, inefficient, or doesn't integrate well with existing systems."

            {
                "id": 2,
                "title": "Contextual Awareness",
                "explanation": "Automated code generation frequently lacks the ability to maintain context across large codebases or multiple related systems. It struggles to remember design decisions made earlier, understand the relationships between different modules, or enforce architectural constraints. This results in code that’s fragmented and difficult to maintain or extend."
            },
            {
                "id": 3,
                "title": "Handling Complex Algorithms and Data Structures",
                "explanation": "Generating sophisticated algorithms, especially those involving complex data structures, remains a significant hurdle. LLMs often rely on simplified representations and can produce algorithms that are inefficient or incorrect when scaled to real-world problems. Precise specification and validation of these algorithms are exceptionally difficult to automate."
            },
            {
                "id": 4,
                "title": "Testing and Verification",
                "explanation": "Automatically generating comprehensive test suites for generated code is incredibly challenging. While unit test generation is improving, verifying the overall correctness and robustness of the generated system – particularly concerning edge cases, concurrency, and security – requires human expertise. The ability to ‘think like a debugger’ and anticipate potential failure modes is a key differentiator that automation hasn't yet achieved."

            {
                "id": 5,
                "title": "Domain-Specific Knowledge Integration",
                "explanation": "Code generation systems typically lack deep domain expertise. Generating code for specialized fields like finance or medical devices requires intricate knowledge of industry standards, regulations, and best practices, which are difficult to encode into an AI system. Generic code generation tools often produce outputs that are technically correct but unsuitable for a specific application domain."

            {
                "id": 6,
                "title": "Maintaining Code Style and Consistency",
                "explanation": "Ensuring generated code adheres to a specific coding style, follows established naming conventions, and maintains overall consistency within a project is a persistent problem.  While style guides can be incorporated, the models often produce variations that require significant manual intervention to align with team standards – a process that can negate some of the efficiency gains of automation."

            {
                "id": 7,
                "title": "Refactoring and Adaptation",
                "explanation": "Automatically adapting existing code (refactoring) to fit new requirements or integrate with updated systems is a very complex task. The model needs to understand not just the syntax but also the intended purpose of the original code, which is difficult to infer accurately without human intervention. Simply re-generating code based on a new prompt rarely solves the underlying architectural problems."
