                },
                "explanation": "At low scale (e.g., small teams, simple applications), manual requirements gathering and documentation are prevalent. Medium scale involves some use of collaborative tools and templates for structured documentation. High scale, with large, complex projects, often utilizes formal requirements management tools and model-driven development, but significant manual effort remains for translating those models into detailed code generation instructions."

                },
                "explanation": "Low scale uses primarily manual template creation based on best practices and common patterns. Medium scale leverages code generation frameworks and tools to assist with template creation and versioning. High scale employs sophisticated model-driven development tools that automatically generate templates from architectural models, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort."

                "explanation": "Across scales, parameter management is increasingly automated. Low scale relies heavily on manual configuration. Medium scale uses configuration management tools and YAML or JSON files to define parameters. High scale leverages model-driven approaches where parameters are directly embedded in the architectural model, offering greater control and traceability."

                },
                "explanation": "Low scale often utilizes scripting and manual invocation of code generation tools. Medium scale leverages dedicated code generation platforms and tools that automate the execution process and provide feedback. High scale relies on continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines with fully automated code generation as part of the build process."

High scale implements extensive automated testing, including integration tests and potentially model-based testing, triggered as part of the CI/CD pipeline."

        "overall_assessment": "The current level of automation for code generation is primarily ‘Medium’ across all production scales. While there’s been significant progress with frameworks and tools, a substantial portion of the process (especially requirement gathering and initial validation) still involves manual effort. High-scale deployments represent the most advanced application of automated code generation, closely tied to model-driven development and CI/CD pipelines. However, further advancements in AI-powered code generation and intelligent template design promise to dramatically increase automation rates in the future."
