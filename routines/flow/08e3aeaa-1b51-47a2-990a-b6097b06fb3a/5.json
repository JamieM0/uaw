            "title": "Basic Mechanical Assistance – Code Completion & Boilerplate Generation",
            "status": "Currently widespread",
            "description": "This phase focuses on automating repetitive coding tasks that are relatively simple and rule-based. It's largely about reducing keystrokes and speeding up the initial stages of development.  The core principle is providing pre-built structures and suggestions based on known patterns.",
            "examples": [
                "**GitHub Copilot (Basic Suggestions):** Provides inline code suggestions as developers type, primarily based on context and common code patterns (e.g., generating `for` loops, `if` statements, basic method signatures).",
                "**Tabnine:** Another AI-powered code completion tool that learns from a developer’s coding habits and project context to offer more tailored suggestions than basic editors.",
                "**IntelliJ IDEA Code Completion & Quick Fixes:** Leverages static analysis and code templates to suggest completions and automatically correct simple syntax errors (e.g., suggesting variable names based on type hints).",

            "title": "Integrated Semi-Automation – Contextual Code Synthesis & Refactoring",
            "status": "Currently in transition",
            "description": "This phase builds upon Phase 1 by incorporating more sophisticated understanding of code semantics and project context.  Automation shifts from simple suggestions to generating larger code blocks and suggesting automated refactoring.  The systems begin to understand the *intent* behind the code and can proactively suggest improvements and transformations.",
            "examples": [
                "**GitHub Copilot (Advanced Refactoring Suggestions):**  Beyond simple completions, Copilot identifies opportunities to refactor code (e.g., extracting methods, simplifying expressions) and suggests the automated changes.",
                "**Codex (OpenAI - More Complex Logic Generation):** Codex is capable of generating code from natural language descriptions of functionality, moving beyond simple syntactic completions to generating more complex logic for APIs and database queries.",
                "**Sourcery:** Automatically identifies and suggests fixes for common code smells (e.g., duplicate code, overly complex methods) within a codebase.",
                "**DeepCode (Now Snyk Code):** Analyzes code for security vulnerabilities and generates automated remediation suggestions – moving beyond simple static analysis to generating fixable code.",
                "**Automated API Generation from Schema:** Tools that generate code (e.g., REST controllers, data models) from API definitions (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger specifications), including basic CRUD operations.",
                "**AI-Powered Code Documentation Generation:**  Tools that automatically generate documentation (e.g., Javadoc, Sphinx) from code comments and code structure – understanding the intent and context to generate more informative documentation."

            "title": "Advanced Automation Systems – Dynamic Code Generation & Microservice Orchestration",
            "status": "Emerging technology",
            "description": "This phase involves systems that can dynamically generate code based on runtime data and complex business logic.  It moves towards automated creation of microservices and integration with DevOps pipelines. The AI demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of the software architecture and aims to automate significant portions of the development lifecycle, including testing and deployment.",
            "examples": [
                "**AutoML for Data Pipelines (Code Generation for Transformations):** AI-powered tools automatically generate code for data transformations based on data schemas and business rules. This could include generating SQL queries, Spark jobs, or Python scripts.",
                "**AI-Driven Microservice Orchestration:** Systems that automatically generate and deploy microservices based on specified APIs and business requirements.  Includes generating service contracts, deployment configurations, and orchestration logic.",
                "**Reactive Programming Frameworks (AI-assisted):** Tools assisting in the generation and maintenance of reactive codebases (e.g., using ReactiveX) by automating the creation of event handlers, state management logic, and subscription management.",
                "**Automated Test Case Generation (Scenario-Based):** Systems that generate more complex test cases based on business requirements and code coverage analysis, including generating integration tests and end-to-end tests.",
                "**AI-Based Code Optimization:** Tools that automatically optimize code performance by identifying bottlenecks and generating code improvements based on real-time metrics and profiling data.",
                "**Dynamic Code Generation from Business Rules Engines:** Systems generating code directly from complex business rules defined in a rule engine, ensuring consistent application of business logic across different systems."
