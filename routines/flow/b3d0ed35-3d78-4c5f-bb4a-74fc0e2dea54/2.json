IMPORTANT: Avoid duplicating steps that already exist elsewhere in the tree context provided. Focus on sub-steps that are specific to the current task being expanded. Format your response as a valid JSON array of step objects, where each object has a 'step' field and optionally a 'children' array containing substeps. Example format: [{'step': 'Main step 1', 'children': [{'step': 'Substep 1.1'}, {'step': 'Substep 1.2'}]}, {'step': 'Main step 2'}] Your entire response must be parseable as JSON.
