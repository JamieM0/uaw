        "historical": {
            "1920s-1940s": "Early Automation – Mechanical Security Devices. This era primarily focused on physical security automation. Examples include early time-based locking systems, rudimentary burglar alarms using mechanical timers and bells, and early fire detection systems relying on thermal switches.  The focus was largely reactive and simple.",
            "1950s-1960s": "Rise of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) & Basic Rule-Based Systems.  PLCs, initially developed for industrial automation, began to find application in security. Simple, rule-based systems started emerging, like automatically locking doors at a specific time or triggering alarms based on pre-defined events (e.g., motion detection linked to an alarm). Data input was primarily manual.",
            "1970s-1980s": "Emergence of Network-Based Security & Early SIEMs. The rise of computer networks led to the development of early network-based security tools.  Simple Network Management Systems (NMS) started to be used for basic monitoring. Rule-based SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems began to appear, primarily focusing on log analysis and alerting. Manual investigation and response remained dominant.",
            "1990s-2000s": "Growth of Network Security & Early SOAR Concepts. The internet boom drove significant investment in network security.  More sophisticated SIEM systems evolved, and the concept of Security Orchestration started to take shape – primarily through manual integration of security tools. Scripting and basic automation of repetitive tasks (like patching) emerged, but remained largely manual.",
            "2010s": "The Rise of SOAR & Automated Incident Response. SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) platforms began to mature. These platforms offered a more integrated approach, allowing for the automated orchestration of responses to security incidents.  Machine learning started to be incorporated for basic threat detection and prioritization, but largely as an assistant to human analysts.",
            "2020s": "AI-Powered SOAR & Advanced Automation. Large language models (LLMs) are integrated into SOAR platforms"
        },
        "predictions": {
            "2030s": "Ubiquitous SOAR & Context-Aware Security. SOAR platforms will be seamlessly integrated into every security operation.  AI will drive proactive threat hunting, automatically investigating anomalies and predicting potential attacks based on vast datasets.  Full threat intelligence feeds are automatically correlated and prioritized. Automation handles 80-90% of routine incident response tasks. Organizations will primarily manage 'risk profiles' rather than individual incidents.  Edge computing plays a larger role in real-time threat analysis.",
            "2040s": "Self-Learning Security Orchestration. SOAR platforms will be fully self-learning, continuously adapting their response strategies based on past and current threat data.  Predictive security – anticipating attacks before they occur – becomes highly sophisticated.  Decentralized security models, utilizing blockchain for verifiable threat intelligence and automated policy enforcement, gain traction.  Human analysts focus on strategic security planning and complex investigations requiring nuanced judgement.",
            "2050s": "Fully Autonomous Security Ecosystems.  SOAR becomes fully integrated into a global, interconnected security network. AI-driven systems manage entire ecosystems, automatically detecting, responding to, and mitigating threats across organizations. Policy enforcement is entirely automated. Physical security is tightly integrated with digital security, including autonomous drones and robots for threat assessment and response. The concept of 'security' shifts towards proactive risk management and resilience.  Digital twins of critical infrastructure are used for simulated attack testing and automated defense.",
            "2060s": "Post-Human Security Intelligence. The majority of threat intelligence is generated and analyzed by sophisticated AI systems, exceeding human capabilities.  The role of human analysts is largely advisory and strategic, focused on ethical considerations, policy development, and ensuring the system's alignment with societal values.  Full system transparency and auditability are guaranteed through blockchain-based verification.  The focus is on building resilient systems that can inherently withstand attacks, rather than solely reacting to them.",
            "2070s+": "Existential Security – Simulation and Replication.  Given the potential for advanced AI to create entirely synthetic threats, security focuses on simulation and replication. Systems autonomously test and validate defenses against hypothetical, hyper-realistic attacks, learning continuously from the simulations. The goal is not just to protect assets, but to ensure the continued function of civilization in the face of unpredictable, potentially adversarial intelligence. (This prediction acknowledges a potential future where intelligence itself becomes the primary security challenge.)"
