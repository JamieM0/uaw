                "**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Rule-Based Correlation:** Automating alerts based on pre-defined signature matches and simple log correlation events (e.g., multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address triggering a notification).",
                "**Basic Vulnerability Scanning Automation:**  Scheduled scans utilizing tools like Nessus or Qualys automatically generating reports based on pre-configured rules and thresholds. The outputs are then manually reviewed and acted upon.",

                "**Automated Endpoint Isolation with Threat Intelligence:**  Integrating threat intelligence feeds directly into endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to automatically isolate endpoints exhibiting suspicious behavior based on enriched threat data.",
                "**Automated Response to Phishing Campaigns:** SOAR platform integration with email security gateways to automatically block known malicious domains, quarantine emails, and trigger user awareness training based on detected phishing attempts.",
