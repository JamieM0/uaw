        "overall_assessment": "The automation level in breadmaking varies significantly across scales. Low-scale bakeries primarily rely on manual labor and basic tools, while high-scale bakeries have adopted significant automation across several stages, particularly in mixing, shaping, baking, and packaging. The trend is towards increased automation, driven by the need for consistency, efficiency, and reduced labor costs. However, the cost of implementing and maintaining advanced automation systems remains a significant barrier for smaller bakeries."
