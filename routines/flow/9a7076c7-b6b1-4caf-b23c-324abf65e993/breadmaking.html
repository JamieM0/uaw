                        Breadmaking represents a deeply rooted craft, traditionally reliant on manual skills and experience. The process encompasses numerous stages ‚Äì from measuring and mixing ingredients to shaping, proofing, and baking. While automation can enhance certain aspects, like precise temperature control or automated shaping, the core techniques and sensory assessments remain fundamentally human. Current efforts in breadmaking automation primarily focus on leveraging sensors to monitor dough temperature and humidity, and systems that provide guidance based on these readings. However, the artistry and nuanced adjustments required to achieve desired texture, flavor, and appearance still necessitate human expertise.  Significant potential exists for automating shaping and portioning, alongside optimized proofing environments.  Despite these possibilities, achieving fully autonomous bread production, particularly considering variations in flour types and environmental conditions, remains a challenging goal, and therefore represents only a partial automation journey at this stage.

Maintain a consistent stirring action throughout this stage.</p>

Maintain a consistent pressure ‚Äì approximately 3-4 pounds. Rotate the dough 90 degrees after every 30 seconds of kneading. Continue kneading for 3 minutes, maintaining a steady pace and consistent pressure.</p>

Continue kneading for an additional 2 minutes, focusing on developing the gluten structure. Observe the dough‚Äôs elasticity; it should become smoother and more elastic with each rotation. If the dough becomes excessively sticky, add a small amount (approximately 1 tablespoon) of flour at a time, incorporating it fully before adding more. Monitor the dough‚Äôs texture, aiming for a smooth, slightly tacky consistency.</p>

Take a small piece of dough and gently stretch it with your fingers. If it stretches thin enough to see light through it without tearing, the dough is properly kneaded. If it tears easily, continue kneading for another minute, observing the dough&#39;s consistency closely. The final dough mass should be smooth, elastic, and cohesive, exhibiting a slight sheen.</p>

Confirm the dough is resting on a lightly floured surface, approximately 20 centimeters by 20 centimeters.</p>

The cloth must be rectangular, measuring 40 centimeters by 40 centimeters. Ensure the cloth is folded in half lengthwise, creating a 20 centimeter by 40 centimeter rectangle. Place the folded cloth on a stable surface directly adjacent to the dough, maintaining a distance of 15 centimeters.</p>

Align one of the 40 centimeter edges of the cloth with the nearest edge of the dough, maintaining a gap of exactly 2.5 centimeters between the cloth‚Äôs edge and the dough‚Äôs edge. This gap must be maintained consistently throughout the process.</p>

With a smooth, deliberate motion, bring the lifted side down over the dough, ensuring the entire surface of the dough is covered. Maintain a downward trajectory of approximately 30 degrees. The cloth should drape evenly across the dough. Do not allow the cloth to overlap the dough&#39;s edges by more than 1 centimeter.</p>
                                                                    </div>

This action should be smooth and controlled, preventing any tearing or pulling of the cloth. Maintain a consistent tension across the cloth.</p>

Continue rolling the dough in 90-degree increments, rolling for 3 seconds each time. After completing four full rotations (360 degrees), assess the diameter of the dough circle. Using a ruler, measure the diameter. The diameter should be between 8.5 and 9 inches (21.59 cm - 22.86 cm). If the diameter is outside this range, adjust your rolling pressure slightly and repeat the process. Ensure the dough is evenly distributed and free from any cracks or tears.</p>

Small, artisanal bakeries largely rely on manual processes and traditional techniques. Medium-sized bakeries incorporate some automation for efficiency, particularly in baking and packaging. Large-scale industrial bakeries demonstrate the highest levels of automation, utilizing sophisticated systems for nearly every stage of the process, driven by the need for consistency, high-volume production, and cost reduction.
