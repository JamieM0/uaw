Medium-sized bakeries incorporate some automation for efficiency, particularly in baking and packaging. Large-scale industrial bakeries demonstrate the highest levels of automation, utilizing sophisticated systems for nearly every stage of the process, driven by the need for consistency, high-volume production, and cost reduction.  However, the 'art' of breadmaking – the nuanced understanding and skillful execution of the process – remains critically important across all scales."
