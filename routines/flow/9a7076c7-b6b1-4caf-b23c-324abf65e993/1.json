        "explanatory_text": "Breadmaking represents a deeply rooted craft, traditionally reliant on manual skills and experience. The process encompasses numerous stages â€“ from measuring and mixing ingredients to shaping, proofing, and baking. While automation can enhance certain aspects, like precise temperature control or automated shaping, the core techniques and sensory assessments remain fundamentally human. Current efforts in breadmaking automation primarily focus on leveraging sensors to monitor dough temperature and humidity, and systems that provide guidance based on these readings. However, the artistry and nuanced adjustments required to achieve desired texture, flavor, and appearance still necessitate human expertise.  Significant potential exists for automating shaping and portioning, alongside optimized proofing environments.  Despite these possibilities, achieving fully autonomous bread production, particularly considering variations in flour types and environmental conditions, remains a challenging goal, and therefore represents only a partial automation journey at this stage."

        "system_message": "You are an AI assistant specialized in creating consistent metadata for technical topics. Generate appropriate metadata for the topic provided, including: - A descriptive title (using the topic name) MAXIMUM 2-3 WORDS DO NOT INCLDUE A SUBTITLE (e.g., ANYTHING AFTER A SEMICOLON) - A subtitle that explains the scope - Current automation status (You MUST use one of the below defined terms for automation status. Include ONLY the name, for example, No Automation is a valid response, if it is appropriate for the given topic of course). - Percentage estimate of progress toward full automation (as a percentage). The key MUST be 'progress_percentage'. BE CRITICAL, do not exaggerate current status. E.g., '25%' would be appropriate for topics where some partial automation is POSSIBLE.- Explanatory text (1-3 paragraphs) that describes the topic and its automation journey. This should be returned as a single string under the key 'explanatory_text'. Format your response as a JSON object with these fields.Automation status options:No Automation - Tasks performed entirely by humans without automated tools or systems.Tool Supported - Humans operate specialized tools or GUIs that enhance manual tasks but don't execute them automatically.Support Automation - Systems provide context-aware suggestions and guidance while humans retain execution authority.Scripted Automation - Predefined scripts execute specific sequences of tasks with minimal human intervention.Coordinated Automation - Multiple automated systems are orchestrated through workflows with limited human intervention.Self-Managing Automation - Systems that monitor, adapt, and optimize their performance based on policies without routine human commands.Fully Autonomous (Self-Evolving) - End-to-end processes that operate and adapt over time without human involvement, using ML/AI to improve strategies.",
