                "title": "Fermentation Complexity",
                "explanation": "Bread fermentation is a highly complex biochemical process governed by numerous variables: temperature, humidity, yeast strain, flour composition (protein content, bran levels), and initial dough conditions.  Current automation struggles to accurately replicate these conditions and the resulting, unpredictable changes in gas production and flavor development. Precise control systems for recreating the ‘natural’ environment required for optimal yeast activity are extremely challenging to implement and maintain consistently.  Simulating the microbiome diversity and the nuanced interactions within the dough is currently beyond the capabilities of even sophisticated sensors and control algorithms."

                "explanation": "The quality of ingredients (flour, water, salt) varies significantly based on season, supplier, and storage conditions.  Automated systems must constantly monitor these inputs and adjust processes accordingly, a task that’s complicated by unpredictable variations. Furthermore, accurately assessing the freshness of ingredients – particularly the activity of the yeast – is difficult, as this changes over time and is heavily influenced by environmental factors. Current sensors lack the sensitivity to detect these subtle changes, making proactive adjustments challenging.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 5,\n      \"title\": \"Human Expertise Replication\",\n      \"explanation\": “Master bakers possess decades of accumulated experience, allowing them to intuitively adjust processes based on subtle observations – the feel of the dough, the aroma, the appearance of the crust. Capturing and replicating this ‘tacit knowledge’ in an automated system is incredibly difficult. While machine learning can be used to analyze data, it’s unlikely to fully understand or compensate for the nuanced judgments of a skilled artisan."
