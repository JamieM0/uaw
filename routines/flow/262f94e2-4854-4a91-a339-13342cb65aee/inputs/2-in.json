    "system_message": "You are an AI that breaks down complex tasks into hierarchical steps. For each task, generate a set of sub-steps needed to complete it. Maintain clarity and logical order. IMPORTANT: Avoid duplicating steps that already exist elsewhere in the tree context provided. Focus on sub-steps that are specific to the current task being expanded. Format your response as a valid JSON array of step objects, where each object has a 'step' field and optionally a 'children' array containing substeps. Example format: [{'step': 'Main step 1', 'children': [{'step': 'Substep 1.1'}, {'step': 'Substep 1.2'}]}, {'step': 'Main step 2'}] Your entire response must be parseable as JSON. Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or commentary.",

Task: Train Personnel on Automated System Operation and Maintenance\n\nDo NOT repeat steps that have already been created in the tree unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\nFocus on sub-steps that are specific to this task and avoid duplicating steps that already exist in the broader process.\n\n\nExisting steps in the tree (avoid duplicating these): Automated Warehousing, Define Warehouse Layout and Zones, Conduct Space Assessment: Analyze warehouse dimensions, ceiling height, and existing infrastructure., Determine Primary Product Flow: Identify the main routes for incoming and outgoing goods., Define Zone Categories: Establish distinct zones based on product type, storage requirements, and order fulfillment priorities (e.g., raw materials, finished goods, temperature-controlled)., Allocate Zone Sizes: Determine the appropriate square footage for each zone based on anticipated volume and SKU density., Establish Zone Access Routes: Design pathways for equipment and personnel movement within each zone., Create a Zoning Diagram: Produce a visual representation of the warehouse layout, clearly demarcating zones and access routes., Document Zone Specifications: Detail the specific requirements for each zone, including temperature, humidity, and storage protocols., Implement Inventory Tracking System, Select Inventory Tracking Software: Research and choose an appropriate inventory tracking system based on budget, features, and integration requirements., Evaluate Software Options: Compare different inventory tracking systems, considering scalability, reporting capabilities, and user interface., Assess Integration Capabilities: Verify the software’s compatibility with existing systems, such as the WMS., Define Data Fields: Specify the data points to be tracked for each SKU, including quantity, location, lot number, expiration date, and condition., Identify Key SKU Attributes: Determine the critical information needed for accurate inventory management., Map Attributes to Data Fields: Align SKU attributes with the chosen software’s data fields., Install and Configure Software: Install the chosen inventory tracking software on relevant devices and configure it with the defined data fields., Set Up User Accounts and Permissions: Establish user accounts with appropriate access levels., Configure Data Input Methods: Determine how data will be entered into the system (e.g., manual entry, barcode scanning)., Test the System: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the system accurately tracks inventory levels and data., Perform Pilot Testing: Implement the system in a limited area to identify and address any issues., Verify Data Accuracy: Regularly audit data to confirm it is correct and reliable., Train Warehouse Staff: Provide comprehensive training to warehouse personnel on how to use the new inventory tracking system., Develop Training Materials: Create user guides and tutorials., Conduct Hands-on Training Sessions: Provide practical training on using the system's features., Configure Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS), Define AS/RS System Requirements: Specify storage capacity, retrieval speed, and product types to be handled., Select AS/RS Hardware Components: Choose shelving units, automated vehicles, and control systems based on requirements., Install AS/RS Hardware: Physically install the shelving units and automated vehicles within the defined zones., Configure Control System: Set up the central control system to manage vehicle movements and storage operations., Test Automated Vehicle Operations: Conduct thorough testing of vehicle movement, storage, and retrieval processes., Integrate AS/RS with WMS: Establish communication and data exchange between the AS/RS and the warehouse management system., Develop Routing Algorithms for Automated Vehicles, Research Existing Routing Algorithms: Investigate algorithms suitable for autonomous vehicle navigation, including A*, Dijkstra's, and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)., Define Operational Zones for Vehicles: Identify distinct areas within the warehouse where automated vehicles will operate., Establish Vehicle Navigation Objectives: Determine the specific goals for each vehicle's route (e.g., deliver to specific location, pick up item)., Implement Pathfinding Logic: Develop algorithms to calculate optimal routes based on defined objectives and constraints (e.g., shortest distance, avoidance of obstacles)., Integrate with WMS for Real-Time Data: Connect the routing algorithms with the WMS to receive dynamic updates on inventory locations and order priorities., Simulate Routing Scenarios: Use simulation software to test the algorithms in various warehouse layouts and scenarios., Evaluate and Refine Algorithms: Analyze performance metrics (e.g., travel time, energy consumption) and iterate on the algorithms to improve efficiency., Integrate with Warehouse Management System (WMS), Assess
