    "system_message": "You are an AI that breaks down complex tasks into hierarchical steps. For each task, generate a set of sub-steps needed to complete it. Maintain clarity and logical order. IMPORTANT: Avoid duplicating steps that already exist elsewhere in the tree context provided. Focus on sub-steps that are specific to the current task being expanded. Format your response as a valid JSON array of step objects, where each object has a 'step' field and optionally a 'children' array containing substeps. Example format: [{'step': 'Main step 1', 'children': [{'step': 'Substep 1.1'}, {'step': 'Substep 1.2'}]}, {'step': 'Main step 2'}] Your entire response must be parseable as JSON. Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or commentary.",

Task: Implement Continuous Delivery (Automated Release Process)\n\nDo NOT repeat steps that have already been created in the tree unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.\nFocus on sub-steps that are specific to this task and avoid duplicating steps that already exist in the broader process.\n\n\nExisting steps in the tree (avoid duplicating these): CI/CD Pipelines, Define CI/CD Goals and Objectives, Identify Key Business Outcomes, Determine Desired Release Frequency, Establish Quality Gates for Releases, Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for Deployment, Quantify Success Metrics (e.g., Deployment Lead Time, Change Failure Rate), Select CI/CD Tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps), Research Available CI/CD Tools, Identify Tool Features, List Required Features (e.g., Pipeline Orchestration, Test Integration, Reporting), Compare Features Across Tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps), Evaluate Tool Costs and Licensing, Assess Team Skills and Expertise, Identify Existing Skillsets, Determine Learning Curve for Each Tool, Create a Shortlist of Potential Tools, Conduct Proof of Concept (POC) with Top Tools, Document POC Findings and Recommendations, Configure Source Code Repository (e.g., Git), Create a New Git Repository, Choose a Remote Hosting Provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), Create an Account with the Chosen Provider, Initialize a New Repository within the Provider's Interface, Configure Initial Branching Strategy (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow), Define Repository Structure and Conventions, Establish a Standard Directory Structure, Define Commit Message Conventions, Set Up User Permissions and Access Controls, Connect Local Development Environment to Repository, Install Git on Local Machine, Configure Git with Remote Repository URL, Add Remote Repository as a Tracking Branch, Define Build Process (e.g., compilation, packaging), Identify Build Toolchain, Define Compilation Steps, Specify Packaging Processes, Determine Packaging Formats, Configure Build Scripts, Set Up Automated Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E), Select Testing Frameworks (Unit, Integration, E2E), Create Test Suites for Each Level, Configure Test Runners and Execution Environment, Implement Test Data Management Strategy, Integrate Test Frameworks with Build Process, Schedule Automated Test Execution, Configure Deployment Targets (e.g., Staging, Production), Determine Deployment Target Requirements (Staging, Production, etc.), Identify Infrastructure Needs for Each Target, Determine Server Specifications (CPU, Memory, Storage), Identify Network Requirements (Bandwidth, Security), Assess Application Compatibility for Each Target, Configure Deployment Environments, Set up Network Connectivity between Environments, Configure DNS Records, Establish Secure Communication Channels (VPN, TLS), Define Access Controls and Permissions for Each Environment, Establish Deployment Procedures, Document Rollback Procedures for Each Target, Define Monitoring and Alerting Configuration for Each Environment, Implement Continuous Delivery (Automated Release Process)\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON array of step objects, with no markdown formatting, code blocks, or extra text.",
