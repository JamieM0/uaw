Medium scale deployments demonstrate a shift towards automation for build and deployment, but integration and testing may still be largely manual. High scale organizations have mature CI/CD practices incorporating full automation across the entire pipeline, leveraging sophisticated tools and strategies for resilient and efficient software delivery. However, the successful implementation of high-scale automation requires significant investment in tooling, training, and a cultural shift towards DevOps practices."
