        "overall_assessment": "The automation levels in breadmaking vary significantly depending on the production scale. Low-scale bakeries primarily rely on manual labor, while high-scale operations leverage advanced automation across nearly all stages, from ingredient sourcing to final packaging. Medium-scale bakeries represent a transitional space, utilizing automation selectively but still retaining significant manual input. Overall, technological advancements are increasingly driving automation in breadmaking, particularly in high-volume production, but human skill and judgment remain vital for quality control and innovation."
