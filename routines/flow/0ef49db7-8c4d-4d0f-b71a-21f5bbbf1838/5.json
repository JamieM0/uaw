                "**Temperature and Humidity Controlled Proving Cabinets with Predictive Algorithms:** Cabinets with digital control and basic algorithms that predict proofing time based on temperature, humidity, and dough weight - still requires human validation.",
                "**Automated Dough Baller (Weight-Based):** Devices that precisely dispense dough balls using calibrated rollers and volumetric sensors, offering increased accuracy compared to manual scooping.",
                "**Automated Shaping Stations (Simple):** Robotic arms assisting with the initial shaping of dough into basic forms (e.g., boules) with pre-programmed movements, but needing human guidance and correction."

                "**Automated Scoring Systems (Laser/Knife Assisted):** Robots equipped with laser or knife-based scoring systems that can automatically score bread loaves with varying patterns, controllable through a software interface.",
                "**Predictive Maintenance Systems:** Utilizing sensor data from baking equipment (mixer, oven, sheeter) to predict potential maintenance needs, minimizing downtime and optimizing resource allocation – reliant on trained personnel to interpret data.",
                "**Automated Oven Loading/Unloading (Semi-Automated):** Conveyor systems combined with robotic arms that partially automate the loading and unloading of baked goods, increasing throughput and reducing labor costs, but requiring human monitoring for quality control."
