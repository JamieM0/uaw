        "explanatory_text": "Breadmaking, at its core, is a fundamentally manual process deeply rooted in tradition and skilled technique. The creation of bread involves several key stages – mixing, kneading, proofing, and baking – each significantly impacting the final product’s texture, flavor, and appearance. While modern equipment like stand mixers and proofing cabinets can assist, the fundamental methods, from shaping the dough to controlling oven temperature, remain largely reliant on human expertise and judgment. Current automation efforts are focused on assisting with precise temperature control and dough hydration, but true autonomous breadmaking – adapting recipes and techniques dynamically – is still a significant challenge due to the inherent variability of ingredients and environmental factors.  This wiki page aims to detail both traditional breadmaking methods and the emerging use of technology to support and, to a limited extent, automate certain aspects of the process. We will examine techniques for different bread types (sourdough, baguette, artisan loaves), alongside exploring how smart ovens and sensors can provide guidance and improve consistency, though complete automation remains elusive."

        "system_message": "You are an AI assistant specialized in creating consistent metadata for technical topics. Generate appropriate metadata for the topic provided, including: - A descriptive title (using the topic name) MAXIMUM 2-3 WORDS DO NOT INCLDUE A SUBTITLE (e.g., ANYTHING AFTER A SEMICOLON) - A subtitle that explains the scope - Current automation status (You MUST use one of the below defined terms for automation status. Include ONLY the name, for example, No Automation is a valid response, if it is appropriate for the given topic of course). - Percentage estimate of progress toward full automation (as a percentage). The key MUST be 'progress_percentage'. BE CRITICAL, do not exaggerate current status. E.g., '25%' would be appropriate for topics where some partial automation is POSSIBLE.- Explanatory text (1-3 paragraphs) that describes the topic and its automation journey. This should be returned as a single string under the key 'explanatory_text'. Format your response as a JSON object with these fields.Automation status options:No Automation - Tasks performed entirely by humans without automated tools or systems.Tool Supported - Humans operate specialized tools or GUIs that enhance manual tasks but don't execute them automatically.Support Automation - Systems provide context-aware suggestions and guidance while humans retain execution authority.Scripted Automation - Predefined scripts execute specific sequences of tasks with minimal human intervention.Coordinated Automation - Multiple automated systems are orchestrated through workflows with limited human intervention.Self-Managing Automation - Systems that monitor, adapt, and optimize their performance based on policies without routine human commands.Fully Autonomous (Self-Evolving) - End-to-end processes that operate and adapt over time without human involvement, using ML/AI to improve strategies.",
