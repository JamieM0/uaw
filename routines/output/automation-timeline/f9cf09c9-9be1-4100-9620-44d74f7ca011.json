        "historical": {
            "1920s-1930s": "Early theoretical foundations. While not directly quantum computing, the work of pioneers like Max Planck and Albert Einstein on quantum theory (specifically the quantization of energy) laid the groundwork. The concept of 'quanta' was established, crucial for later development.  Early attempts at building machines based on quantum principles were largely theoretical and unsuccessful.",
            "1940s-1950s": "The Dawn of Quantum Mechanics.  Schrödinger's equation (1926) and the development of quantum mechanics as a complete theory.  Significant advancements in understanding superposition and entanglement, though practical application remained distant.",
            "1960s-1970s": "Bell's Theorem & Experimental Verification. John Bell's theorem (1964) challenged classical physics and provided a testable framework for quantum phenomena. Early experiments began to demonstrate violations of Bell's inequalities, solidifying the strangeness of quantum mechanics.",
            "1980s-1990s": "Superconducting Qubits & Early Quantum Algorithms.  Researchers began experimenting with superconducting circuits as potential qubits.  David Deutsch's work on universal quantum computation (1985) provided a theoretical framework for building a quantum computer. Shor's algorithm (1994) for factoring large numbers was proposed, highlighting the potential for quantum speedup.",
            "2000s-2010s": "Increasing Experimental Progress.  Significant advancements in qubit fabrication and control.  Researchers at IBM, Google, and others began building increasingly complex superconducting qubits.  The first demonstration of quantum supremacy (claimed by Google in 2019, though debated) marked a pivotal moment.",
            "2020s-Present": "NISQ Era & Algorithm Development.  We are currently in the 'Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum' (NISQ) era.  Quantum computers are still prone to errors, but progress is being made in qubit coherence and control.  Research focuses on developing quantum algorithms for specific applications (optimization, materials science, drug discovery) and error mitigation techniques.  Continued investment and competition drive rapid advancements."

        "predictions": {
            "2020s-2030s": "NISQ Refinement & Specialized Applications. Qubit counts will increase significantly (1000-10,000 qubits). Error correction techniques will become more sophisticated, allowing for more complex calculations. Quantum computers will primarily be used for niche applications – simulating molecular interactions for drug discovery, optimizing complex logistics, and financial modeling. Cloud-based access to quantum computers will become more prevalent.  Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms will be the norm.",
            "2030s-2040s": "Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing Emerges.  Significant breakthroughs in error correction will lead to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with thousands to millions of qubits.  Algorithms capable of tackling truly complex problems – like protein folding and materials design – will become available.  Quantum machine learning will begin to show practical advantages in specific areas.  The cost of quantum computing will decrease, making it accessible to a wider range of industries.",
            "2040s-2050s": "Quantum Advantage Across Industries. Quantum computers will routinely outperform classical computers on a broad range of problems.  New materials and drugs will be designed with unprecedented speed and accuracy.  Financial markets will be revolutionized by quantum algorithms.  Significant advancements in fundamental science – cosmology, particle physics – will be enabled by quantum simulations.  Quantum cryptography will become standard for secure communication.",
            "2050s-2060s": "Ubiquitous Quantum Computing – Hybrid Systems Dominate. Quantum computers will be integrated into nearly every aspect of modern life.  Hybrid quantum-classical systems will be commonplace, seamlessly handling complex calculations.  Quantum sensors will provide unprecedented levels of precision in measurement.  The concept of 'quantum cloud' will be fully realized, offering on-demand access to quantum resources.",
            "2060s-2080s": "Full Automation & Quantum-Driven Innovation. Quantum computers will drive a new era of technological innovation, leading to breakthroughs in areas currently considered science fiction – room-temperature superconductivity, advanced robotics, and potentially even the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI) through quantum-enhanced learning.  The line between quantum and classical computing will blur entirely, with quantum effects influencing everyday devices and processes.  Complete automation across numerous sectors will be achieved, driven by the computational power of quantum systems.",
            "2080s-Beyond": "Post-Humanity? (Highly Speculative).  The potential for truly self-improving, quantum-enhanced AI raises profound questions about the future of humanity.  If AGI is achieved through quantum means, its capabilities could far surpass human comprehension, leading to a fundamentally different trajectory for civilization. This scenario is highly speculative and dependent on unforeseen technological and philosophical developments."
