        "Nuclear power plants make electricity by using heat from nuclear fission. Here is how they work:",
        "",
        "1. Nuclear Fission Reaction",
        "Inside the reactor core, fuel rods with uranium-235 or plutonium-239 split atoms and release heat. Control rods, made of boron or cadmium, regulate the reaction by absorbing extra neutrons.",
        "",
        "2. Heat Generation & Coolant System",
        "Heat from fission is transferred to a coolant (usually water or liquid sodium). In most reactors, water acts as both a coolant and moderator (slowing neutrons to sustain the reaction).",
        "",
        "3. Steam Production",
        "Heated coolant turns water into steam in a separate system. In Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), water is kept under high pressure to prevent boiling and heat is transferred to another water loop to create steam. In Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), water boils directly inside the reactor, generating steam.",
        "",
        "4. Electricity Generation",
        "Steam drives a turbine, which spins a generator to produce electricity.",
        "",
        "5. Cooling & Condensation",
        "After passing through the turbine, steam is cooled in a condenser, converting it back into water. This water is recycled into the system while excess heat is often released via cooling towers or nearby water sources.",
        "",
        "6. Safety & Waste Management",
        "Spent nuclear fuel is stored in cooling pools or dry casks until it can be safely disposed of. Safety systems, like containment structures and emergency cooling, prevent radiation leaks.",
        "",
        "Nuclear power plants provide a steady and efficient energy supply with low carbon emissions, making them a key part of many global energy grids."
