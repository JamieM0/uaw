        "overall_assessment": "The automation level in bread making varies significantly across scales. Low-scale bakeries primarily rely on manual labor and basic tools, while high-scale industrial bakeries have embraced extensive automation, including robotic handling, precise temperature control, and automated packaging. Medium-scale bakeries represent a transitional stage, incorporating some automation for efficiency gains without the full investment of high-scale operations. The trend is clearly towards increased automation, particularly in high-volume production, driven by factors such as labor costs, consistency, and scalability."
