    "facts": [
        "- Bread is primarily made from flour (usually wheat), water, salt, and yeast as the main ingredients. Other ingredients like sugar, milk, eggs, or fats may also be added for flavor and texture improvement.",
        "",
        "- The process of bread making involves using a mixing bowl or dough mixer to combine these ingredients until a cohesive dough forms. For optimal results, the ideal ratio is 100 parts flour to around 57 parts water by weight (by volume, this translates roughly to about 2 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour with 1 1/4 cups of water).",
        "",
        "- A bench scraper or bread lame can be used for shaping the dough. Yeast is typically allowed to ferment for at least an hour but can take up to several days depending on the recipe and method.",
        "",
        "- During baking, a temperature range of 375째F (190째C) to 450째F (230째C) is commonly used in a convection oven or conventional oven with steam injection. The time required ranges from 20 minutes to over an hour depending on the recipe and size of the loaf.",
        "",
        "- After baking, bread should be allowed to cool for at least 15-30 minutes before slicing to prevent moisture loss and improve texture.",
        "",
        "- Packaging materials such as plastic or paper bags are used in varying thicknesses. Vacuum sealing is also common but typically reserved for longer storage times.",
        "",
        "- Transportation of packaged bread often involves specialized vehicles with climate-controlled conditions to maintain freshness during transit, especially when long distances are involved."
