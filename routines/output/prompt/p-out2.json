    "facts": [
        "1. Raw Ingredients:",
        "- Wheat flour is the primary ingredient, typically using 500 grams (17.6 ounces) per loaf.",
        "- Water is added at approximately 325 milliliters (about 11 ounces).",
        "- Salt, usually about 10 grams (0.35 ounces), enhances flavor and structure.",
        "2. Equipment:",
        "- Mixing: Use a stand mixer or manual dough hook with a mixing bowl to combine ingredients.",
        "- Fermentation: Employ proofing baskets or plastic containers for initial rising.",
        "- Baking: Utilize a baking stone or sheet preheated at 450°F (232°C) in an oven.",
        "3. Mixing:",
        "- Knead the dough until gluten forms, typically for about 10 minutes.",
        "- Divide the dough into portions of around 200-300 grams each for shaping.",
        "4. Fermentation:",
        "- Allow the dough to rise twice; first at room temperature for 90-120 minutes, then refrigerated overnight (about 8 hours).",
        "5. Baking:",
        "- Score the surface with a lame or sharp knife before baking.",
        "- Steam the oven to create a crust during the first few minutes of baking.",
        "6. Cooling:",
        "- Place baked bread on a wire rack away from direct heat.",
        "- Cool completely, which takes about 30-45 minutes.",
        "7. Packaging:",
        "- Store in a paper bag or cloth to maintain moisture and freshness.",
        "- Seal with an elastic band if using a plastic container.",
        "8. Transportation:",
        "- Use cardboard boxes lined with newspaper for protection during transport.",
        "- Stack carefully, ensuring each loaf is supported by the one below it."
