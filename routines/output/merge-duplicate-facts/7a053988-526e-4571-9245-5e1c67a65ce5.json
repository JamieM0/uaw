        "The fact \"Industrial mixers are used to blend the dough thoroughly\" provides additional information about the purpose of using industrial mixers, so it was not merged.",
        "The fact \"Mixing is done with high-capacity industrial mixers\" is very similar to the modified original fact and does not add any unique detail, so it was merged into that fact.",
        "The fact \"Bread production involves mixing ingredients in large mixers\" provides additional information about the scale of the mixers used, but the term \"high-capacity\" already implies a large scale, so it was not merged.",
        "The fact \"Quality control is performed during the mixing phase\" adds unique detail about when quality control occurs, so it was preserved as a separate fact."
