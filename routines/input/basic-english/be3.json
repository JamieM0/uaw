  "input_text": "Nuclear power plants generate electricity by harnessing the heat produced from nuclear fission. Hereâ€™s how they operate:\n\n1. Nuclear Fission Reaction\nInside the reactor core, fuel rods containing uranium-235 or plutonium-239 undergo fission, splitting atomic nuclei and releasing heat.\nControl rods, made of materials like boron or cadmium, regulate the reaction by absorbing excess neutrons.\n2. Heat Generation & Coolant System\nThe heat from fission is transferred to a coolant (usually water or liquid sodium).\nIn most reactors, water acts as both a coolant and a moderator (slowing neutrons to sustain the reaction).\n3. Steam Production\nThe heated coolant turns water into steam in a separate system.\nIn Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), water is kept under high pressure to prevent boiling, and heat is transferred to a separate water loop to create steam.\nIn Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), water boils directly inside the reactor, generating steam.\n4. Electricity Generation\nThe steam drives a turbine, which spins a generator to produce electricity.\n5. Cooling & Condensation\nAfter passing through the turbine, steam is cooled in a condenser, converting it back into water.\nThis water is recycled into the system, while excess heat is often released via cooling towers or nearby water sources.\n6. Safety & Waste Management\nSpent nuclear fuel is stored in cooling pools or dry casks until it can be safely disposed of.\nSafety systems, like containment structures and emergency cooling, prevent radiation leaks.\nNuclear power plants provide a steady and efficient energy supply with low carbon emissions, making them a key part of many energy grids worldwide.",
